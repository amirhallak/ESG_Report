With this product, if you were going to buy a makeup sponge I could see this being a better option, based on my googling.  On their website they say it's made of ""sugarcane bio-based material"".

Coke is a hard, porous, nearly pure carbon product made by heating coal in the absence of air (in coke ovens). Coke acts as both a fuel and reducing agent in the blast furnace, forming carbon monoxide when burned, and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten pig iron and carbon dioxide. In 2017, every ton of steel produced resulted in an average of 1.83 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That same year saw a global production of just over 1,864 million tons of steel.

New production processes are exploring the use of hydrogen gas instead of coke. Hydrogen reacts with iron oxide in a similar fashion to carbon monoxide, but instead of producing carbon dioxide, the only byproduct is water vapor. When hydrogen used in this process is derived from renewable or decarbonized sources itself, the steel making process can become completely emission-free, creating ‘green steel.’""

These reports are generally the best we have and they're not great at actually telling you how sustainable an organization is. 

The second, could be one of many providers of Environmental Social, and Governance (ESG) reports. To be blunt, these reports are fucking greenwashed bullshit. If you find one in the wild, wipe your ass with it because it will have more value.  Unfortunately, ESG is used by investors, consumers, and even researchers to measure sustainability. There is ample research explaining why ESG is bullshit. Different providers (Bloomberg, DJIA, Thompson-Reuters, MCSI and about 100 others) have different standards, qualities, transparencies, and requirements. Companies can pick and choose with ESG service will make themselves look good. Additionally, the rankings each provider seems to produce never converge. If you do go this route, SustainAlytics is one provider probably doing the most right. 

A huge problem in sustainability reports and data, as others have noted, is greenwashing. Additionally, true sustainability is more of a psychology to be studied qualitatively rather than a quantitative pursuit. Judging organizations on whether they are sustainability weak or strong is a task we are struggling to figure out. We kind of know what those ideals mean, but in practice, measurement is fucking complicated.

One of the best things to do when inspecting the condition of containers is to have somebody close you inside (oooh scary) and see if and then where light comes through. Then you'll see if the rubber that insulates the door is good and if rust has degraded the metal anywhere.

Check for rust inside the container as well... rusty tracks from droplets that might be entering from the outside, leaking down the walls. Swollen balls of rust in the roof, walls etc; is it all the way through, has it thinned the walls in some way? 
The condition of the floor boards; fairly easily replaced, but good to check to be aware of whether water has been allowed to fester for lengthy periods on the inside of the container.
Dented and uneven walls; containers can be dented and bent back to shape multiple times. This could pose a problem to structural integrity, but the actual borders - the frame - of the container are the most important in terms of integrity. Damage to the frame can be hard to repair properly. Often, if a door is nearly impossible to close, it can be due to a twisted frame. Usually that is simply because the container is sitting on some uneven surface, but it's good to make sure that it's not due to some damage.

Transportation: Coffee is pretty light and it's shipped in bulk. I only go through about 12lbs a year which is probably not a large carbon footprint from the shipping compared to the rest of my carbon footprint. 

Packaging: I buy my coffee from the bulk bins at grocery stores or the food coop and I reuse the little bags 3 or 4 times before they are worn out. I could instead bring a jar which would probably even keep it fresher.

Farming practices: This is more tricky to measure and track but you could look into some of the brands that are available in your area in bulk bins. I like the equal exchange brand but I havent done much research on them. This is also somewhat tricky since people have different values around farming. Are you concerned with how much the farmers are getting paid or just the climate aspect? I'm not sure about coffee farming in particular, but I've worked on several small orgainc vegetable farms and given some thought to the impacts of farming. Counter intuitively, sometimes large scale monocrop farming with huge equipment can actually have a lower carbon footprint than small diversified farms since they can grow such huge quantities of food. Another counter intuitive example is a pesticide or fungicide might reduce damaged crops and increase yield per acre. These practices have other serious drawbacks to sustainability including insect collapse and chemicals leeching into groundwater but they might not look so bad from a strictly carbon footprint perspective.",greenwashing

They’re not going to say no (unless the supply chain will result in a system crash but thats by the by). This is a far deeper issue rather than having a recycling box in the kitchen. I would recommend researching terms like “degrowth” or talks on the social progress index. Nobel laureate joseph stiglitz has spoken extensively on how our gdp focus is problematic.

It depends on how you define ""worth it"" since you are talking about unquantifiable values in addition to money.  A sustainable fund has to have higher expenses to pay for the research required to ensure it's sustainable, so even if it performs the same as the general market your returns will be lower.

Individual stocks is the most risky since you're basically betting on some specific companies to win.

So, as an FYI, retirement accounts don't get ""compound interest.""  They get ""returns"", which are functionally equivalent, but using the term ""interest"" implies some kind of set rate.

But, more importantly, that financial advisor doesn't know what (s)he is talking about.  The **only** thing that matters when choosing Traditional or Roth is the tax rate.

For example, let's say two people earn $100.  Let's say they each want to invest 10% of their money and taxes are 20%.  So the first one does Traditional (non-Roth).  So the $10 goes to their retirement, leaving them with $90, which gets taxes 20%, leaving them with $72 income (and $10 in their retirement account).

The second person chooses Roth instead.  So they get taxed 20% right off the bat, dropping them from $100 to $80.  Then they invest their 10%.  So that means they have $8 in their retirement account (and $72 in income, just like the first person).

Then, over the years, let's say their retirement accounts grow 50%.  So the first person's $10 goes to $15, and the second person's $8 goes to $12.

Then they take their money out in retirement.  The first person owes tax on their $15 dollars; the second person doesn't owe tax on their $12 (because they paid their 20% when the money was going in).  So the first person withdraws their $15 and pays 20% tax.  Guess what that leaves them with?  $12.  The exact same amount that the person who did Roth has.

The only thing that matters is the tax rate.  If you think your tax rate is higher now than when you need the money (i.e., retirement), then go Traditional (in order to defer taxes to when they're lower); if you think your tax rate is lower now than when you need the money, then go Roth (in order to pay taxes now when they're lower).",greenwashing

I can sell nuclear power to climate change deniers (it's cheaper, it's safer, energy independence, etc.), but I cannot sell nuclear power to Greens.

youre not going to slowdown production without slowing down demand, and if you want to change demand, you need to change the behavior of people.

h&m is a clothing company. it is not on them to convince people to spend less on clothing, in fact they'd be the last company you would go to to do such a thing. as far as what a clothing company IS capable of doing, selling greener fabrics is a great way to move forward.

You're mad at the company for trying to be more sustainable and changing their fabric material (something you're are supposedly in favor of). I understand greenwashing is real, but you get mad at people for not being sustainable and then when they try, you accuse them. The article also talks about customer behavior but a business gotta sell. We should welcome new ideas and sustainable practices instead of complaining. I personally still wouldn't buy from h&m as it's quite expensive for me, but I respect them for trying. It's not like they are lying about using the material.

ex7t3m,fg8gk3p,icalledthecowshome,"I'm really bored so I'll add my observations:

1. Fast fashion is slowing down, nothing will change the trend. What used to be high volume orders are now 1200pc/style - for mid range brands. Low end stuff like AE is dying, and it's still supported by Wall Street which results in high volume crap quality orders = waste.

2. Viscose is synthetic crap texture, it's generally used in to low range quality goods. If you want to be environmental friendly it shouldn't even be produced in the first place. There are good uses for synthetics like water absorption clothes, but people dispose them even though they can be reused a number of times.

3. Organic cotton is a fraud, you can use it as a marketing term or say cottons are farmed with better biodynamics. No one in the production industry buys organic yarn. Hence you don't see high end brands using ""organic"" cotton. Cotton is is technically super advanced with a high range of  treatment and the range of textures is superior for many different types of uses. You can consider recycle cotton or find a way to dispose of it environmentally instead of wasting resources to produce more synthetics but cost would be higher than generally accepted.

If it had that extra protection, could it rebuild into sturdy multi-year ice, and kick-start a local process of ice regrowth? She settled on silica - or silicon dioxide - which occurs naturally in most sand and is often used to make glass, as the material of choice.

>”The science is very clear,” Spivak said. “We need to slash our carbon pollution by 50% over the next 10 years if we want to avert the worst impacts of global warming and keep global warming to a 1.5C increase.”

Guys I know is Bernie supporters sound like broken records (kind of like the man himself) but this is a very serious issue. 

In the second to last debate Bernie opposes Klobuchar and Warren’s MCA deal because it offloaded pollution and only made America appear to be going green. 

Bernie just fundraised $46 million in the month of February alone. Which is substantially more than most candidates have raised the entire election. 

We can get green legislation passed. Bernie’s green new deal will subsidize green initiatives while creating millions of jobs. 

We need to pass green legislation that is substantial and satiating to Mother Earth. We also need to get oligarch influence out of politics. Bloomberg admitted in the SC debate to buying candidates from both sides of the aisle, red and blue. 

It’s no longer just a Republican problem. It’s corruption by the fossil fuel industry in execs on both sides who are halting this legislation from passing to the extent we need it to be effective.",greenwashing

ceyjq9,eu5ut2a,IgnisDomini,">Two board members of the New York LCV work as lobbyists for the Williams Companies, the Tulsa-based energy company trying to gain approval for a pipeline off the Rockaways, reports LittleSis, a publication of the nonprofit world watchdog Public Accountability Initiative that has been researching LCV. Grassroots environmentalists oppose that pipeline because fracking exacerbates climate change and pollutes human drinking water; they’re also concerned about the project’s likely devastation of marine wildlife around New York City. (Jacobin reported in May on some of the good people protesting this project.)

>[...]

>Hook is also a spokesperson for Millennium Pipeline, the company that owns the Valley Lateral Pipeline, which was strongly opposed by grassroots climate advocates. Three other LCV board members have worked for Millennium Pipeline, two as lobbyists and one as the company’s lawyer in its fight with the state to build the Valley Lateral Pipeline. The project will imperil water quality by running through twenty-three wetlands. When New York State blocked the Valley Lateral Pipeline in 2017 (a decision unfortunately overridden by a federal judge last year), citing the company’s failure to consider the project’s climate change effects, NRDC exulted, calling it a “victory for all New Yorkers.”

>**But the ties between Millennium Pipeline and LCV go even deeper. Millennium is a “corporate partner” of the LCV along with other noted tree huggers ExxonMobil, Con Edison, National Grid — and yes, Williams.**

>**All this allows companies to greenwash by appearing to have relationships with a well-known environmental group.** Worse, these relationships inhibit LCV from playing a more significant role in fighting the climate change and pollution caused by the fossil fuel industry. Indeed, they sometimes help to airbrush these horrors: **LCV has not only failed to oppose the Williams pipeline but has endorsed it as having environmental benefits, Politico has reported.**

>[...]

>The political ties of the LCV are even more shocking than the corporate ones. You’d expect the board members of a corporate-friendly environmental group to be made up of those whom Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf has called “soft climate denialists” — e.g., centrist Democrats — rather than the hard climate denialists of the proudly anti-scientific GOP. But **NYLCV’s board includes backers of Donald Trump, whose environmental record is probably the worst of any American president in history.**

>[...]

>The LCV, in Saturday’s statement about the climate debate, declared its decision to be “in line with its values.” That’s fair: choosing to soothe the feelings of the shameless fossil fuel profiteers on Wall Street over fighting for the survival of the 99 percent does seem congruent with at least some of the organization’s “values.”",greenwashing

We need to grow more trees and plants organically, and revert to more traditional building materials like wood for houses. We need to walk more. We need to eat better and wean ourselves off meat (not altogether mind! Meat is delicious - perhaps develop lab meat?). 

We need to focus more on community, and acquire/grow/make products locally and source locally wherever possible, rather than expecting government to supply for us from the global market. And move away from unnecessary and damaging ingredients like palm oil (which is in pretty much everything!) and chemicals like pesticides. 

We should boycott huge, multinational corporations like nestle that don’t give a toss about the environment, and large companies like Target and Walmart that destroy local communities and encourage transport to out of town complexes. (I’m in the uk, I want to say Tesco and Asda)

7d5858,dpvwslb,nebulousmenace,"[This.](http://humoncomics.com/mother-gaia)

More generally: ""Save the planet"" can mean a lot of things. I personally tend to focus on getting greenhouse gases back in balance, ideally in the long term back down to something like 320 PPM. 

But clarity of writing leads to clarity of thought, and ""save the planet"" is hideously unclear. Are we saving it from asteroids? 

I try not to think about the broad picture because it's incredibly depressing; there's a lot of positive feedback loops (arctic/antarctic ice, methane coming out of permafrost, etc.) that are going to be very difficult to reverse.

My feeling is that step 1 is reduce every source of GHG by about 90% (electricity generation, transportation, farming, deforestation, etc.) My reason for that: 

1) The first 90% is cheaper than the last 10%; [Pareto principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) etc. 

2) If we cut emissions by 90% that gives us ten times longer to solve the remaining problem. 

3) There are a lot of independent problems ( we could potentially solve electricity generation and transportation but not cement and farming, or whatever.) The remaining problems are going to be so disproportionate that 90% vs. 100% makes no difference. 

To give a hopefully-clear example, if we dropped electric grid CO2 by 100% [to 0, in other words] and didn't change anything else, we would go from 100% of current CO2 to about 70%. If we dropped electric grid CO2 by 90% and didn't change anything else, we would go from 100% to about 73%. The things we don't fix will swamp the difference between ""Entirely fixed"" and ""Almost entirely fixed."" 

Could I, given near-dictatorial powers, implement step 1? I know how to do it for the grid. I know how to do it for transportation (it's more expensive.) I don't know much about concrete, deforestation, industrial process heat, or anything else - maybe the experts know how to do it and it's not hard, maybe it's death on toast. 

Step 2 ... if we succeed in step 1 we have time to work on figuring out step 2. ",greenwashing

7d5858,dpws08b,Tetrazene,"Depends on what element of ""saving the planet"" you're focused on. I'd assume it's emissions/GHG. [Contributions by sector](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data) would be a good place to start. If we switched to 100% renewables instantaneously for only electricity and heat, it'd eliminate ~25-40% (the higher value would include local generation of heat/power at industrial sites). If you include completely 100% electric transportation, that's another 15%. We could probably get to 75% reduction with a large increase in total energy output that's 100% renewable. There's still a significant amount (25%) that's generated directly or indirectly from agriculture. That includes methane from livestock, food waste, and loss of carbon sinks from deforestation/desertification or seasonally non-productive land. I think the problem of carbon fixation hasn't received as much attention with regard to climate stability. 

Even the Paris Agreement assumes a large amount of commercial scale sequestration in order to maintain a <2 C increase of global averages. Planting an assload of fast-growing trees/grasses then burying it would help. Sequestration is at least as important and it's less trivial since the tech is pretty nascent. There's really only two methods: chemical conversion, or compressed/concentrated storage. There are many small scale examples of the former, but there would need to be at least 35-45 gigaton of CO2 per year to account for current emissions and probably a total of close to 550 Gt if you want to return to 1870 CO2 concentrations. [Current and planned](https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/large-scale-ccs-projects) projects have a total capacity of ~40 Mt/year, which is about 1000x less than what we'd need as above.

Thirdly, look at where emissions are coming from (hint: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data). You can see from this that if tomorrow we replaced all coal/gas power stations with wind turbines and solar panels, then we'd reduce emissions by 25%. The next biggest emissions source is 'agriculture, forestry and other land use'. You can research this for yourself, but most of these emissions come from cow farts and tree chopping. There are no existing technological fixes for these, so we can't reduce emissions on the supply side! We need to think about the demand side of the equation, and reducing meat consumption is key to reducing global emissions.

Fourthly, for the effectiveness of any change, we need to consider timescales. If you look at the UN carbon budgets latest research coming out of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, they're suggesting we need to completely decarbonize by 2050, with developed countries taking the lead and decarbonizing earlier (2035).

Fifthly, good luck! ;)",greenwashing

jqvllf,gbpvij8,," Greta Thunberg has blasted politicians as hypocrites and international  climate summits as empty words and greenwash. Until humanity admits it  has failed to tackle the climate crisis and begins treating it as an  emergency like the coronavirus pandemic, society will be unable to stop  global heating, she said.

In an interview with the Guardian, Thunberg said leaders were happy  to set targets for decades into the future, but flinched when immediate  action to cut emissions was needed. She said there was not a politician  on the planet promising the climate action required: “If only,” said the  teenager, who will turn 18 in January.

But she is inspired by the millions of students who have taken up the school strike she began by herself in Sweden [116 weeks ago](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1324613338450579456). Since then she has [addressed the UN](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/greta-thunberg-speech-un-2019-address)  and become the world’s most prominent climate campaigner. She also has  hope: “We can treat a crisis like a crisis, as we have seen because of  the coronavirus. Treating the climate crisis like a crisis – that could  change everything overnight.”

Thunberg said the [scale and speed of the emissions reductions](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/even-climate-progressive-nations-fall-far-short-of-paris-agreement-targets/)  needed to keep global temperature close to the limit set by the Paris  climate agreement are so great that they cannot be achieved by the  normal operation of society. “Our whole society would just shut down and  too many people would suffer,” she said.

“So the first thing we need to do is understand we are in an  emergency \[and\] admit the fact that we have failed – humanity  collectively has failed – because you can’t solve a crisis that you  don’t understand,” Thunberg said.",greenwashing

It feels like we could replace most coal plants with nuclear plants and then slowly work on increasing renewables as well as increasing energy efficiency. This would lower GHG emissions quickly and drastically.",greenwashing
bijwij,em2jdpy,zolikk,"Okay, let's check out some of the things this article puts forward in a misleading way.

Exhibit A:

>Nuclear power is not what anyone can consider carbon neutral. While it could be said that the fission inside a nuclear reactor does not produce much carbon dioxide,...

Intermission: yes, ""none"" could indeed be said to be ""not much"".

>...that is only one part of the total lifecycle of atomic energy production. Beyond the operation of the reactor, the nuclear fuel cycle includes the mining, milling, processing, enrichment, fabrication, and transport of the uranium-based fuel. Each step is energy intensive and [creates a lot of greenhouse gases](https://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/ask-pablo-is-nuclear-power-really-carbon-neutral.html).

Here the article wants to argue that nuclear has a significant carbon footprint so it should be disregarded as a solution to global warming from the start.

But it seems like it didn't read the actual source it quotes.

Because that source claims that nuclear's carbon intensity is roughly on par with wind, and essentially almost zero carbon compared to, say, California's overall carbon intensity. (here that source calculates 15g/kWh for nuclear and links to another one showing 10g/kWh for wind; this seems about right where IPCC puts them, at 12g/kWh and 11g/kWh respectively).

So yes, each single nuclear power plant has a big carbon footprint, but when you assess how much that contributes to each MWh of energy generated, it's actually one of the lowest carbon footprints of any energy source available.

Hence this attempt at discrediting nuclear as a low-carbon source relies simply on the reader not looking at the source quoted.

&#x200B;

Exhibit B:

>“For nuclear power to make a meaningful contribution to reducing CO2 emissions, 1,000 to 2,500 reactors would have to be operating globally by mid-century,”  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>To get to 1,500 new reactors would require firing up a new one every two weeks for the next 60 years, which is not only an impossible schedule to meet, but puts the planet long past its drop-dead date for zero greenhouse emissions.

Is that an impossible schedule to meet? The article simply implies that because it takes 10-20 years historically for the US to build one plant, this schedule of one per two weeks globally is ridiculous and impossible.

But in the past few years China alone has added 5-6 reactors per year. That is one every 8-10 weeks. Is it so outrageous to suggest for the whole world to add reactors at a rate equal to 3-4 Chinas?",greenwashing

The packaging is in theory recyclable because it's physically possible to recycle it. However, the machines used to sort different plastics most likely wouldn't ""see"" it correctly and I've never seen a local recycling list that accepted plastic fibres, and if the film was pierced, then you've got microplastic fibres everywhere. So in practice it's not curbside recyclable and it having that label is greenwashing and is likely to end up with people inadvertently contaminating the recycling stream.       
If, instead, the packaging said ""made from recycled PET. Mail to xxx for specialised recycling so it can be used again. Otherwise, discard with landfill waste"" then it would be fine.

Maybe try looking for what was in some of their old boxes - if you can consistently say ""yes these are all things I need"" across several boxes, maybe it's for you! If not, maybe give it a pass.

I never subscribed, not out of some great principled calculation or anything, but because it seemed, for the most part, like a way to acquire more *stuff*. Things that replace consumables are obviously good, but what about the month they send me a food storage thing? I'm already a sucker for food storage containers at TJ Maxx, I don't need more! My guess is that a) you are ahead of me in the zero waste transition/process and b) it'll be more efficient to browse their website (or a competitor's) and go ""hey, yeah, that's a thing I should switch to"" and note it down for when you run out of $whatever.

That's absolutely a consumer mindset that needs to be broken, but it's also really really hard to get away from, so if baby steps would help, it's an option. Does that make sense? I know I'm kind of rambling here. It's definitely not ideal, but it's not as bad as it could be, for what it's worth. Definitely better for beginners than people who are already well on their way, because duplicates are a drag (but I've given them to friends who are interested in sustainability but aren't super into the ""work"" yet, if that makes sense, so at least they don't go to waste?).

I will say that though I canceled my subscription, I still buy things from their site, you don't have to have a subscription to do so.

I hate wasteful packaging just as much as everyone else here, but sometimes I think we focus so much on the plastic bottle it comes in that we forget how much waste is potentially generated (or prevented!) by the company on the manufacturing side. 

But yeah. The cartons bothered me, which is why I went with Blueland instead of Cleancult for the available cleaning products. Blueland's model also means that you're not paying to ship liquid, which is nice. 

For the stuff that isn't available from Blueland ... I'd rather buy a giant, #2 plastic jug of detergent than these mixed-material cartons. Based on my rather limited knowledge of recycling, a large piece of one type of plastic, like a laundry detergent jug, is one of the types of things most likely to actually be recycled because it's easier to sort. I know there are Dropps and those sheet-based laundry detergents, but Dropps are $0.19/load and the sheet-based ones are at least $0.25/load, vs my big jug of BioKleen at $0.08/load.

1. People call for more envionmental education and push for reusing materials...then as soon as a big company does something the same people complain because it's ""not enough"" or ""their other practices don't make up for recycling a few things"". Come on! Stop having a double standard...you want them to do nothing?!? Support them when they do something good...if you do maybe they will do more.

2. Few actually know what greenwashing is and just throw the term around. Greenwashing is disinformation or lies about green practices. Many don't understand this. Asking people to recycle is not greenwashing. Greenwashing would be saying ""Hey this jumbo jet is green for these reasons"", but the reasons are actually just a farce because there isn't any difference between a current jumbojet and a ""green"" one. Basically, you just throw a green title onto a product that is the same as a ""non-green"" product. I see this all the time in the engineering construction industry...for example one house was labelled as ""energy efficient"" and then another house was labelled as a ""green home"". The""green home"" was actually less efficient that the energy efficient home. That is greenwashing...asking people to recycle is not.",greenwashing

Petco sells 40lb bags of cat litter, and buying the 40 lb bags is less plastic, so buying in ""bulk"" just deceives the customer.

Your previous example isn't greenwashing because the company is spending money and labor to get those bottles recycled. Things like a 10 cent buy back are to encourage customers to recycle, it's a small ""nudge"" to change wasteful habits. Being green shouldn't be some sort of terrible experience that makes businesses insolvent, but it should provide nudges and insentivies to find a green option that works for theit business. For example, if a company composts their cafeteria's food waste to also lower their trash bill this is not greenwashing, but a win/win for both parties. We want green to make sense.",greenwashing

Another problem is the fact that companies get rich off of crappy, single use products. Meaning that buying something that lasts can be an actual investment.

gid9qf,fqfq66m,peony_chalk,"Their argument seems to be that palm oil isn't sustainable because anywhere it's grown at scale used to be dense, untouched forest, and that forest had to be razed to support the palm plantations. They aren't wrong, but the same argument could be made against pretty much every crop. Most things we grow en masse are grown on land that used to support a natural (non-agricultural) ecosystem, and monoculture and invasive land practices are going to be detrimental to a lot of species and diversity wherever they are.

People love coconut oil, but coconuts are grown in a lot of the same places as palm trees. I guarantee there are places where forest ecosystems are being razed to support coconut plantations the same way they were razed to support palm plantations, but coconut oil has thus far avoided palm oil's bad rap. Prairies were razed to grow wheat and corn and soybeans. Old-growth forests are now pine plantations. We're diverting water from rivers to irrigate crops grown in deserts.

I've heard that Dr. Bronner's has their own palm plantations, and I would trust them more than most companies to pay a living wage to their workers. Their blog post about it says that their farms ""were developed without the widespread clear-cutting of rainforest"", which sounds good -- like this is probably as sustainable as palm oil gets -- but like all corporate announcements, I think it should be viewed with some skepticism.

I wish I knew what the solution was here. Consumers should make better choices? Companies should use their buying power to force change? Governments should have stricter regulations that actually get enforced? Farmers should change how they grow things to preserve more of the natural vegetation? I'm sure somebody smarter than me has some good ideas. And for the record: I'm not absolving us of responsibility just because the problem is bigger than we are; this isn't a ""if I can't do everything, I won't do anything"" argument. I believe in the power of one. If you want to apply your power of one by choosing to avoid palm oil, go for it!

Thankfully, it's easy to find bar soap without palm oil. There are quite a few olive-oil-only soaps, or sometimes they'll do mostly olive with some other oils mixed in. Olive oil makes soap that can feel a little slimy, be soft, and not lather as much; palm, coconut, sunflower, or other oils can help make the bar harder and lather better. (I'm currently using olive-only soap and it's still great, just maybe a little different from what you're used to.) Here's a [olive+sunflower bar from Chagrin Valley](https://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/p/soap-castile-simply/), or an [olive+coconut bar from Ethique](https://ethique.com/products/charcoal-kaolin-oatmeal).

They didn't have any plastic in their shipping, and you get one set of bottles to reuse. (I think they used to be glass, but now they seem to be a sturdy plastic--not ideal, but designed for reuse and shatterproof.)  They come with starter tabs, which dissolved well in warm water, and when those are used up you just order more tabs--much smaller shipping footprint, and apparently the tab packaging is compostable too.  I would certainly recommend!",greenwashing
h85m2h,furtikc,peony_chalk,"I think the benefits of selling/shipping dry products that the consumer adds water to are real, and I think the benefits of using only biodegradable packaging are real. I don't know enough about the chemicals in their formulations to comment on that one way or another, but I generally trust that they've put effort into making their products non-toxic and ""green"" in some way.

I think their bottles, specifically the cleaning product spray bottles, are maybe a liiiiiitle bit greenwashing. Like yes, refilling is a good idea and we should all try to do it more often, but we don't need their very aesthetically-pleasing bottles to do so. If the pretty bottles make more people more likely to use the products, I guess that's good, but I don't like the idea that we should all buy into this ""system."" 

My advice in hindsight: buy the refill tabs and skip the bottles. I got my set back in early March and already broke one of the sprayers, and another one seems like it's on its way out. I'm sure they'd replace the sprayers if I asked, but I thought they were unpleasant to use anyway, so it's not a loss to me to just replace them with sprayers from other old bottles that I like better (they're a standard size, thank goodness.) If you do reuse an old bottle, just make sure to measure your water carefully; a lot of other cleaning bottles are either 16 or 32 oz, and the Blueland tablets make 20oz of cleaner. (Keep that in mind if you're price-comparing as well.)

I think the glass cleaner works really well, with the bathroom cleaner being a close second. I mostly use it as a daily shower spray; if you've got major soap scum buildup, you probably want something more heavy-duty. The multipurpose cleaner is just ok; I think Mrs. Myers, or even my homemade dish soap + alcohol spray works better on stuff like stainless steel, my kitchen table, or the glass stove top. I think the refillable soap bottle is great, although the soap itself is kind of ... thin? It feels like it's already as lathered as it's going to get the second it comes out of the foamer, and then it kind of fades away before I've really scrubbed at my hands for 20 seconds. I'll keep repurchasing it anyway because I think it's pretty good, but it's not *amazing*. 

FYI, I got an e-mail last week saying they were launching some new products soon, so if you're thinking about purchasing, you might hold off for a week or two to see what else they've got.

You don't have to buy their spray bottles. Use whatever existing bottles you already have and use a measuring cup to add the right amount of water.
Regarding washing windows, I use vinegar and water  and maybe a little dish soap if the glass is greasy. Plain cotton rag. Dry with a squeegee and then newsprint to avoid streaking.",greenwashing
h85m2h,fusvyyj,epipin,"We have a couple of the hand soap bottles which we love, even my husband who is very picky with scents. I love the idea of just buying the little tablets to refill with. The bottle is very sturdy and the pump works really well.

I have held off on the cleaning tabs because I don’t like the idea of those bottles, tbh. It seems like I would be just buying more plastic - they are made of acrylic which isn’t easily recyclable. I also delved pretty deeply into as many reviews as I can find and while the all purpose cleaner gets good reviews, the others don’t. Also I read some reviews where people complained that their bottles snapped in two. But then having bought into the idea of only having small tablets shipped to me, the idea of something like Cleancult where you are shipping a heavy liquid doesn’t feel right either. So I think when we run out of our current cleaner I will keep the plastic spray bottle from that and buy just the all purpose cleaner refill tablets to try out and see if I like them. I currently just use an all purpose cleaner for everything anyway.

Some new products are supposed to be launching next week. I’m hoping for a hand dishwashing soap.🤞🏼",greenwashing

They can only produce less CO2 emissions (aside from switching to renewables but that is a not a quick solution) if their customers demands less of their product. Who buys energy from them? Well, companies do, and to a smaller extent (I assume), people do. But what about the energy used by companies? Well a lot of that is used to produce goods and services for their end consumer, i.e. people.

No matter which way you look at it, people still end up being the final link in the energy chain, driving the production of energy. That means that we as individuals have to work to reduce our energy and material consumption not just at home but in the companies that we use the goods and services of.

It's a fabulous book that I honestly think anyone who believes personal choice does nothing should read. Plus it's super entertaining. He's a good writer.

e8sbrq,faet3xz,blacmm,"I’m of the mindset everyone should do all that they can! I think many people do get upset though that what they do only has a small impact unless everyone does. I do think it’s also important to push corporations to make changes too though. I don’t like it when people use corporations as an excuse to not try.
Also I notice some people on here do get a little self righteous that they’re zero waste and other people aren’t doing good enough and it gets discouraging to people who are trying(though this is also a minority of people and the community seems mostly very welcoming). I think it’s good to encourage people to do more and encourage them to be politically active to get regulations put on companies if that makes any sense.
Many people use corporations as an excuse but a lot of people are also genuinely concerned about them and I think both the individual and corps being more zero waste is important.

u/theinfamousj is correct, we use a manufacturer who makes products for a number of different companies. This allows us access to a higher class of ingredients than we would have as a small company and helps keeps costs down as they are able to buy in bulk. Because their ingredient mixes are proprietary we don't know all of the information about their suppliers specifically but we have made visits to their factory, met the workers, the chemist and talked about their purchasing policies, which allayed all of our concerns. 

We certainly don't claim to be the silver bullet for personal care sustainability, but I think it's going to take a number of different solutions to help reduce plastic and toxins in the bathroom and we're proud to be one of the solutions.

My solution was to find a lightweight sheet at my local thrift store, the lightest/thinnest i could find (so i wouldnt have to pay much for the added weight). Once i found one (in a color/pattern that i liked, but it doesn't matter), I cut up pieces of the fabric and sewed them together to make drawstring bags. I hand sewed mine, but ofc machine works too. I also just eyeballed the sizes. I suggest 3-4 small/mid-size bags, and at least 2 bigger bags. I use them for loose produce and for bulk and they work great, and are washable!

Wegmans helpfully tared my mason jar, but the cashier I picked couldn't figure out the tare thing either. The front end manager was able to use BASIC MATH to subtract the tare of my jar from the total weight, multiply by the cost per pound and just manually rang it up.

This sounds terrible, but I always try to pick the younger cashiers when I go through with my own jars and bags. They seem to ""get it"" and come up with a solution.

I have also started keeping a little notebook of bulk codes (and tare weights of my jars) for items I buy frequently so they don't have to search the system for the codes.

I can tell you with a reasonable amount of confidence that it will not happen in the foreseeable future. Mainly due to the fact that the in store management has little to no control on what the registers can and cannot do. All the registers receive updates on firmware from a corporate server. The mere suggestion that a manager could just add a feature of their on volition is ridiculous. The employees of a store can only use the features that they are given from corporate.

If you lost your bottle and wanted another, it was like $10 to replace. Big change, and probably high initial cost for the university, but I figure it should pay off over time. I really liked it but there was a lot of pushback from students. I didn't have a meal plan when they started it and haven't had one since so I don't know how successful that was.

For more realistic very short term stuff - if you guys have takeout/cafes/etc - don't bag things as the default. Tell the places to only bag if a student asks for it - if I got a sandwich, I can carry it in one hand. If I put the sandwich in a bag, I'm still carrying it in one hand - there's almost no benefit to the bag. My university bags things as the default so I'd always have to ask for no bag.

Another food thing - meatless Monday at the dining hall. Still have one or two meat options for those that don't want to participate, but put up signs and make more veggie based entrees.

Get those water bottle fillers to put on top of water fountains - I love them and I saw a lot of people using them at my school.

Push for less plastic at school sign sponsored events - you may not be able to stop them from giving out shit like keychains and the little carabiners or pens or whatever, but if they're anything like my school all of those goods probably come in an individual bag, within a larger bag with like 20 items, within a box.

It sounds like what you need is data. 

* What is the composition of your school's waste stream? 
* How much does your school spend on waste disposal?
* Which changes would most reduce the school's trash production?
* Is there a cost benefit to the school in implementing these changes?
* If there is a start-up cost, how long is the break-even period?
* Have these changes been implemented elsewhere? Analyze these situations. What worked well for them? What should they have done differently in hindsight? Were these situations similar to your school?  (E.g.,at one extreme, implementing school-wide composting in a one-room schoolhouse is very different from school-wide composting at a 40,000-student university)
* Have you considered possible unintended harmful consequences of these changes? 

I really admire your optimism. If you think your idea is feasible, then do your research and submit a project proposal. If you discover it's not, then it's time to re-assess and figure out a better approach. ",greenwashing

I wouldn't call this greenwashing.  Greenwashing involves a far more concerted, duplicitous, and ineffective effort than a message that's been there for years and is read by very few people.  

The bag is for take-out, so it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to collect them at Subway when that's not the final destination.  

The vast majority of garbage at a Subway is completely non-recyclable (coated paper cups, dirty sheets of butcher paper, used napkins, food waste, etc.).  If they did have a receptacle for the few things that Subway sells that are recyclable, it would probably get tainted with all the other non-recyclable garbage that idiot customers would inadvertently throw in, making the whole lot end up in a landfill anyway.  

Unfortunately, plastic bags are almost impossible to recycle in conventional facilities.  They get trapped in the sorting equipment where they become hazardous to the workers there.  

So Subway would really need three receptacles (one for bags, one for cans/bottles, one for non-recyclables) and expect every last yahoo from the employee to patrons to be in full compliance.  

And in one last ironic twist, the OP's submission of this is greenwashing their own behavior.  The food sold at Subway is GMO/pesticide laden/factory farmed/you-name-it-bad-for-the-environment and trucked in from thousands of miles away.   If OP really gave that much of a rat's ass about the environment, he'd be eating locally.  

Or at the very least just bring the bag home to go with other plastic grocery bags for recycling at the grocery store where they're well set up to handle this.  ",greenwashing

Seems to me it's a great alternative to coal and much cheaper than nuclear. It's a good stop gap solution to the lack of having a real solution to the need to rise above fossil fuels.

Renewable is great, but solar is not ready, Wind is not available in most places and geothermal is underdeveloped and limited by location as well. 

The only thing better than natural gas that you can use almost anywhere would be thorium reactors, but nobody has proven data on cost per kilowatt. As it stands I doubt any nuclear model for power generation will turn out to be cost effective in the long run because you'll be paying for waste storage for hundreds or thousands of years even long after such technologies have been surpassed by superior technologies. 

Solar will have it's day and more investment from the government wouldn't hurt. BUT dumping money into inefficient solar is just stupid. Spend it on wind power and build natural gas turbines and  you'll have a better net effect of lowering CO2 output.

Any model you chose has to take cost into account and solar just isn't there yet, at least not in most places. Sure maybe in the middle of the desert were nobody lives you can hit 5 cents per kilowatt and be competitive with coal, but in most places you can't yet.

9m0l3s,e7c2zxc,mafco,"Solar and wind are more appropriately called ""variable"" power sources. High penetrations of these on the grid are what necessitate ""flexible"" sources for balancing. Natural gas, hydro, batteries, CSP, geothermal, etc are flexible resources that can be used for this purpose. Nuclear baseload plants not so much due to a variety of reasons. The DOE baseload study report describes this pretty well:

>The electricity industry has traditionally referred to baseload generation as the power plants that are used to meet “base” load—the minimum level of electricity that customers demand around the clock, as illustrated in Figure 1.2. Large nuclear, coal, natural gas steam, and hydroelectric plants have historically been used for baseload generation.e  Baseload plants generally have high capital costs but low fuel costs, and they tend to be fairly fuel efficient. Although the output level of these plants can be changed, they are most economic—in terms of cost per unit of electricity produced—when operated at near-full capacity at all times (although hydroelectric plants are more flexible). Traditional baseload units tend to have longer start-up and shut-down times and generally move (ramp) slowly between production levels to avoid damaging plant components with thermal stress or metal fatigue (see Appendix C on cycling).  
>  
>**Appendix C**  
>  
>Existing U.S. nuclear power plants were designed with a similar goal of operations at a set generation output, and—with few exceptions—they were not designed with flexible operation modes. Fuel is loaded in 18-month or 24-month cycles, thus keeping the marginal cost of operation low. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission prohibits nuclear power plant control systems from interfacing or being automatically controlled from grid network control systems,482 so what limited load following is allowed must be scheduled from one to three days in advance and is in small increments of power output.483  Nuclear units receive no benefit to load following or ramping, as they do not save on fuel costs. Like fossil plants, ramping a nuclear plant will also result in more wear and tear due to thermal gradients and mechanical stresses and will likely increase capital expenditures. Less restrictive, but still carefully controlled, nuclear load following is permitted and utilized in other countries, such as France, for which nuclear has a higher percentage of electricity output on the system.

c5ola,c0qamcf,the_nuclear_lobby,"Short answer: It will almost certainly reduce carbon emissions vs. the use of natural gas-sourced electricity and separately-sourced heat for your college, as a result of the benefits of [cogeneration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogeneration).

Despite the reduction, it may not be even be close to carbon neutral on a system level (e.g. a tree cut down and not replanted is highly carbon positive).

Anything that removes trees from the carbon-cycle without replacing it cannot be considered carbon-neutral, so your college will have to remain vigilant in verifying their fuel sources.

Interesting timing for the question, considering the [ruling from the EPA](http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/05/14/14greenwire-biomass-industry-sees-chilling-message-in-epas-60072.html) on greenhouse exemptions for biomass only a few days ago:

>EPA's final rule determining which sources will be subject to greenhouse gas permitting requirements does not exempt biomass power, a decision that has raised concern in the biomass industry.

...

>Emissions from biomass or biogenic sources are treated the same as other sources of greenhouse gases in the final rule, EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn said.

...

>""The science around biomass continues to make clear that not all biomass is good from a carbon footprint perspective,"" Matzner [of the NRDC, not EPA] said. 

>""Some sources of biomass can theoretically be carbon-beneficial [...] On the other side of the fence, chopping down a swath of forest that then gets turned into a parking lot and burning it puts carbon in the atmosphere that's not going to regrow.""

Basically, it depends on the source of wood - mainly on whether an equivalent crop is going to be planted to replace the trees cut down. 

This is the reason the EPA wasn't willing to give biomass a blanket exemption from greenhouse emissions - it is very difficult to generalize and there's a vast amount of conflicting scientific material on the subject that prevents a decisive conclusion.

Essentially the EPA concluded ""insufficient data for meaningful answer"" to the question of whether biomass is carbon-neutral in general.

----

It could also depend on how complete the combustion of biomass will be (incomplete combustion of biomass [releases significant quantities of non-CO2 greenhouse gases](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V74-4876JPP-32&_user=559483&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F1993&_fmt=abstract&_orig=search&_cdi=5832&view=c&_acct=C000028178&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=559483&md5=ef69cfc726051ccbfa8a46d89c4d5d13&ref=full)), although I don't think this should be an issue with a new, high-efficiency incinerator.

And there's always the ancillary concern that the biomass should be locally-sourced to avoid transportation-related emissions, but again, this doesn't sound like an issue in your case.

The biggest concern I would have with this plan is that your college might create an extra demand for biomass that is not currently present, which could lead to the creation of a market for non-waste-derived biomass that isn't replaced (or even possibly things like car tires should there ever be a supply shortfall for biomass and your college needs heat and electricity). 

----

tl; dr: If it's explicitly waste (e.g. lumber tailings) that would have otherwise been left to rot, then it would have released the carbon in any case through natural decay without having provided either heat or electricity for human use, in which case burning it can probably be considered extremely beneficial from a greenhouse standpoint.",greenwashing
