ha8n4g,fv1esua,travisfling,"I would call them out. End of story.
Edit: I’m a Financial Advisor. I started a practice as a fiduciary when I came through the training program. They said I’d never, ever, ever make it without doing commissions. Never in a million years. I said that there was a zero percent chance that I would start a practice and gain people’s trust and then come back later and tell them there had been a better way all along. Don’t get me wrong, it took literally every penny that I had saved and nearly cost everything to get it up and running. But i graduated the training program #1 in the country and now have built a sizable practice that I’m incredibly proud of, doing it the right way, so I’m a little bit passionate about this. It’s hard... very hard to build a practice as a fiduciary. Almost impossible, but I think it’s important. 
And by way OP - you working upmarket and them working in WM in a smaller sense does not exonerate them from doing the right thing. You should do the right thing whether someone has 100k or a billion. Our system should be set up that you do that right thing because people with a lot of money DEMAND it and have options and the little guy gets the shaft. I’m not saying that you’re on that vein, but I wanted to jump in and say don’t feel like the practice you work for is above it solely because of the size. I know you care and know right from wrong, but i would absolutely put them in their place. We can’t stand by and watch, we need to speak up. Just my .02, take it for what it’s worth.

1. Most ""Wall Street"" firms aren't physically on Wall Street.

2. The job you're looking for is either a) at an institutional broker-dealer (or colloquially ""Sales & Trading"") in which case requirements are more-or-less the same as getting into other high finance jobs or b) working as a retail financial advisor with an incentivised additional compensation plan for selling certain funds or products. 

The VHNW/UHNW market isn't going to succumb to BS snake-oil tactics that incentivised RFAs use to try to sell shitty products to people. They either will have their own family offices or be served by a trust company, specialised VHNW/UHNW division/firm or a private bank. None of those settings will resemble what the stock brokers of yore did and none of them will push BS products on their clients unless they add actual value.

To expand on ""a"" above you can cover family offices or UHNWIs that directly invest in S&T as a salesperson or salestrader in which case the job is pretty similar to ""stock broking"" except with far more sophisticated strategies and ideas than telling someone's grandma to buy $C because ""they had a good quarter"".

Like everyone else has said Option 4 gives you a decent base salary and benefits, but TBH I don't love any of these options for a new grad. Here's why: If you want to sell people stuff they likely don't need, and hit sales quotas and commissions based on flavor of the month mutual fund/ins. product/annuity/credit card etc, AND you have a large network of fairly affluent people who will buy from you....sure. But seriously think about it and let's break this down:  


 In option1...10 Accredited clients means 10 people with $1 million of investable/manageable assets (likely outside 401(k), who will say to someone in their early 20s ""here you go manage my money""- possible yes, but likely? No.   


Option 2 - ""advisory firm"" where you're 100% commission - I wouldn't call than an advisory firm, I would call than a churn and burn sales job. Not that much different than #1.

&#x200B;

Option 4- Helping clients make decisions at a bank - sounds decent on the surface, but a college degree in finance with in-house training isn't the level of knowledge you need to seriously say you can independently help people - there's CFAs with years of experience out there you'd be competing with, not to mention really this is another version of # and #2 where ""helping clients"" likely really just means completing some sort of generic questionnaire about risk tolerance and using the score to place them in one of the bank's proprietary mutual funds and/or something that pays the bank revenue (maybe not even a direct commission to you). 

&#x200B;

If I was in your shoes, I would take #3 as a backup because at least you have a base salary that is not dependent on selling people things they don't need and gives you an opportunity to learn something about the business. In a year you could apply to other roles. To be completely candid, I would keep looking and only take this as a backup. If you want to be a financial advisor, then you need to find an entry-level analyst position at a real financial planning firm with the understanding that nobody doing real financial planning is going to let you be the lead advisor in a client relationship, but if you want to grow into that, it is 100% possible to find an analyst role where you shadow client meetings first few months, have client interactions, and eventually learn to be a lead advisor.

ds4b0,c12hhzp,Commander_Q,"Today I got my second huckster email from the Motley Fool. When I got the first one a week or two ago, I figured it was spoofing and just deleted as spam. When I got *another* one today, I checked the link URLs and was flabbergasted to see that it actually did want me to link back to fool.com...

This is really depressing-- they have been one of the best, most honest, and most ethical sources of personal investment information for a long time. Now it seems they are resorting to hawking ""hot tips"" on penny stocks like a bucket shop...

For those who aren't already in the know, when you get emails or solicitations to buy someone's reports or stock tips, they are basically always a scam, just like sports betting tips are. If the author really knew how to make a killing through special knowledge they'd set up a fund and sell shares instead of ""tips."" 

Instead what they do (on the sports betting side) is send out, say, a million inexpensive tip sheets, half of which say to bet on the Patriots, and half say to bet against the Patriots. The next week, half of the original million people made money (or would have made money), so to those ""winners"" go a new half-million ""split"" tip sheets. Next week, only a quarter-million ""won"" on the last tip, and the week after that there are only 125,000 consistent winners. But even as the number of ""winning"" customers gets smaller and smaller, the track record of the tip sheet starts to look supernaturally good for that small number of people who happened to get the winning pick 5 or 6 weeks in a row, especially if some of them advised against the odds. And the tip sheets will often hint at having inside information or secret analytical models or whatever... after five or six weeks in a row, the tipster now has maybe 25,000 customers to whom it has sent (possibly free) tips that have won every single time. And unless those customers are comparing notes with other customers, they have no way of knowing that the ""tips"" are just completely random. Now the tipster offers the big deal, the hugely valuable secret, the point spread of the superbowl or whatever... just $100 for the complete, detailed, top-secret report... And again, it's basically half saying to bet on one team, half saying to bet on the other, with a bunch of stuff copied from Sports Illustrated or whatever as backup.

Penny-stock ""tip sheets"" often work the same way, at best. At worst, they are completely crooked, just a way for a brokerage to dump its own lemons by throwing around a bunch sand about cash flows and debt ratios and comparisons to Google and Dell computers and whatever. 

In short, don't pay for ""tips"". It's sad that the Motley Fool has fallen to this. ",ethical investing

iv3ha2,g5ouui5,Chii,"Have a watch of https://youtu.be/weVAN2HxXjk - it explains a very good case for not investing in ESG funds unless you are completely sure they match exactly your moral values (rather than just marketing). And ESG funds tend to underperform (and charge higher management fees). They underperform because the selection criteria may remove some diversification affects, and others remove profitable companies that make up the total returns of a fund that don't discriminate. 

So in other words, you're paying (fees and underperformance) for essentially a personal preference/taste. If you feel that is worth it - then go ahead. 

My take is that i don't care for anything _except_ for maximum returns. Then, if you feel strongly about ESG, put your money into charities that deal with these issues. Taking action yourself (whether by donating, or by actually doing work for these charities) will have a bigger effect. Divesting from companies you consider unethical will just make the spot open for someone else to invest in - and at a lower price since you removed your own demand that would've pushed the buy-in price higher!",ethical investing
iv3ha2,g5oua5g,dvdmovie1,"It's certainly not a fad - there has been tremendous inflows into ESG products, but - and this is a very cynical take - in many cases that's what they are, ""products."" If you look through many ESG funds, you will often find that some inclusions are questionable at best. I think if people really want something ESG that meets their personal criteria, they're going to have to shop around or build a portfolio themselves. 

""Is the sustainability of a company something you look at when investing, or is the bottom line and potential growth more important?""

Ultimately, if there's not potential growth, it's probably not going to be around at some point. I think the issue that I have with a lot of green investing is that people think ""it's green and green is good and therefore it's a good business"" when that couldn't be further from the truth. There have been/is/will be many terrible/mediocre green businesses. Sun Edison was a terrible business but all the way down to bankruptcy, people on here were going, ""it's solar and solar is good so it's good right?"" No. Something can be green/sustainable and that's nice but if it's not ultimately a good business it's not going to be around for very long.

""But I don't know whether this attitude will end up with me missing out on the gains of other sectors (tech, finance, energy)""

I think you can certainly find some green energy investments that are fine, but certainly you'll miss out on big oil (not that there's anything much to miss there, with most of those companies being stagnant for years even before this crisis.)

The filter will not be literally the filter that you would apply personally - e.g. I'm invested in the one I mention above but for some reason it contains some McDonald's shares which I would rather not have included (some of this can be the result of ""green-washing"" where companies game ESG metrics). If you really want to do things your own way you will have to pick stocks yourself but it will require a lot more effort and attention. So you might need to compromise...

I disagree with the idea that this is necessarily not profitable. The ESG ETFs that I have have shown very similar returns to similar non-ESG ETFs in the last few weeks, for example. Also if you're really thinking long-term I think it makes a lot of sense to choose precisely these kinds of ETFs because the companies included in them are likely to be a bit more sustainable in the long run. Jeremy Grantham is one famous investor who has expressed that you should consider environmental sustainability because a lot is going to change (the world might look very different for oil companies in 30 years, for example), which I think makes a lot of sense.

Personally I find it unacceptable to not consider ethics at all while choosing your investments. Sure, people will tell you investing is just about money and you're an idiot to not just chase profit, and you should change your consumption behavior rather than choose your investments. I think this is nonsense - investments do affect companies, even if it's just a bit (e.g. makes it easier for them to fund operations), and something which I think is highly underappreciated in many of these discussions is how being invested in certain companies might cause certain conflicts of interest for yourself.

a. Shifting indices means companies need to tick different boxes, impacting on KPIs etc. No small matter.
b. With more money invested in ESG funds, both active and passive investment funds will start engaging on the issues selected for those funds. This puts direct pressure on management in companies.
3.	Companies scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of ESG present a clear and present danger to markets as a whole. The recognition of this risk by index fund managers as relevant to their mid-term positions as universal investors (i.e. investors that cannot exit the market) is part of their shifting position on ESG.

Their profits are from membership fees and small margins on sales (1% or so), so they will negotiate the best whole sale price for customers and the sellers win on volume along with exposure of their product. The goods sold are pretty high quality as well. 

Shareholders have great voting rights and they pay a strong consistent dividend. Special dividends of 7 dollars a share at certain times. The customers are treated well and they take proactive approaches to protect customers if mistakes are made.  

Costco is one of my favorite companies, I feel much more comfortable shopping there and investing as opposed to a place like Wal Mart who makes society worse through many questionable business methods. Oh yeah, it's actually ran well too from a fundamental stand point and balance sheet.

7oud83,dsclhow,dying_to_be_vain,">In a perfect world, this fund would trade higher than we would otherwise expect based on risk/return because some element of the social return that didn't show up on the balance sheet would matter to investors, who would pay a premium to know they weren't contributing to social harm.

It might seem really counterintuitive, but this is actually harmful for investors.  Take tobacco as an example.  Over the last 30 years or so, the user base of these companies have been shrinking by about 3.5% anually, yet tobacco companies have been one of the best investments you could have made, in part because severe pessimism and lack of enthusiasm due to an ""unethical"" stock led to perpetually low valuations, which made stock buybacks from these companies particularly effective.  In your case the opposite is happening, and because in the long run, stock returns should mirror underlying earnings growth, in your example, your fund is guaranteed to underperform if investors regularly pay a premium.  That's why, for me personally, I own gun and alcohol stocks, and did own tobacco stocks at one point, but don't currently.  The only line I draw for ethical reasons is private prisons (because the US industrial-prison complex is essentially a blanket endorsement of slave labor) and companies where the majority of their revenue is derived from meat, and a pivot to an entirely meatless offering would be material to the company (because the US agricultural system is its own pit of awful, and uses and abuses animals against their will.)",ethical investing

> The highest ESG-rated companies *in each sector*. The grading is on a curve, and if there’s a whole sector that is not particularly environmentally conscious, then you just invest in the least bad companies in that sector. You couldn’t do it any other way: If you excluded the whole sector just because it is bad for the environment, then you wouldn’t own the same stocks as the broad market, and then sometimes your fund would underperform the index when fossil-fuel companies did well. The goal is not to pick environmentally conscious companies; *the goal is to track the S&P 500 while having “ESG” in the name*. 

> I don’t mean that that’s BlackRock’s goal! It’s the investors’ goal. No one is being *tricked* here. Eight of the top 10 ESG funds own fossil-fuel companies, and they don’t keep their holdings secret or anything; there is a competitive market for ESG funds, and the ones that focus on index tracking seem to outcompete the ones that focus on environmental, social and governance issues. The amount of ESG that ESG investors mostly want, as demonstrated by their revealed preferences, is the minimum amount, the ESG label plus index tracking. ",ethical investing

That implies you either only invest in index funds, or invest in stocks and think your own judgement is good enough to outperform the market.  The former may be defendable, but the latter certainty is not, for most people most of the time.

If a company is a good buy then either you're buying it or someone else will. Realistically a few retail investors won't do anything.

I think another question is where would you even draw the line? I think FB is really damaging to society, but I invest in it. Am I being unethical by my standards? Or should I only worry about certain ethical concerns like exploiting cheap third world labour? I think large global companies are consistently unethical. Almost all of them participate in some degree of tax avoidance, they treat their employees like crap, they exploit our insecurities to promote their products. I wouldn't even know where to begin factoring in all these things.

Then you have the other problem of foreign markets. What if I don't like the Chinese government? Should I avoid all Chinese companies too?

I think in reality if you're concerned about companies meeting most of our western ethical standards then you're going to be left with very few companies to pick from, which I'd be willing to bet underperform the market because being ethical costs.

5r953i,dd5dfnc,dvdmovie1,"An interesting ethical fund - although one that is focused on healthcare given the manager's knowledge of it (see below) - is Eventide Gilead (ETGLX)

*Dr. Finny Kuruvilla has a unique background in healthcare, statistics, and investing. He holds an MD from Harvard Medical School, a PhD in Chemistry and Chemical Biology from Harvard University, a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, and a bachelor’s degree from Caltech in Chemistry. He completed his residency and fellowship at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Children’s Hospital Boston where he cared for adult and pediatric patients suffering from a variety of hematologic, oncologic, and autoimmune disorders. Subsequently, he was a research fellow at MIT where he designed and implemented statistical algorithms involving logistic regression and pseudo-Bayesian expectation maximization. As an avid proponent of values-based investing, Dr. Kuruvilla has developed standards for selecting ethical companies at the outset of the stock selection process. (http://www.eventidefunds.com/our-products/#!gilead)

There is no reason for you to invest with Parnassus directly. Many major brokerages offer their funds and while there may be some variables (minimum may vary, they may be TF funds at some brokerages and NTF at others, although I think the Parnassus Funds seem to be NTF everywhere; NTF = no transaction fee.)

I'm not a fan of ethical funds, because I think many of them are ""products"" that are sold to people who can feel good about investing ethically, but the funds are not very good and whether some of their investments are ""ethical"" is questionable at best. There are few high quality ethical fund options.

The Parnassus Funds (in particular PARWX) have been consistently excellent. Eventide Gilead has done extremely well until the downturn in biotech/pharma in 2015 (and it didn't do that badly, considering.)

Why discourage companies from providing these ""best circumstance"" to lots of people?

Also, although I think that education is really important, I feel that ""child labor"" is not always unethical. Many times, places with child labor have child labor with the child's consent. 

For me, the real important ethical part of this is whether or not the workers consent to work there or whether they are slaves.

gktmtf,fqu4ymm,throwmeanadviceboner,"Hello there--I apologize if this is already a well-worn topic but I wasn't able to find anything from a cursory search around my specific situation.

TL;DR at bottom.

I am a single person in their mid-40's with no kids who squandered the best years of my financial investing life being blind and illiterate to the importance of discipline and understanding how to invest properly for my future. As a result, I have massive anxiety because I have close to nothing planned for retirement and made many many mistakes with my credit which took me time to repair.

However, I did focus a tremendous effort in the last 10 years on repairing my credit so that I am now at 750+.

I eliminated all debt (no credit card carryover balance, ever, car is fully paid off) with the exception of my mortgage.

I closed on my first condo in the suburbs last year and purposely chose it because the monthly mortgage + condo fee was substantially less than what I was paying in rent in the city. I make an additional 30% payment each month on my mortgage as I would like to pay it off in under 20 years (it’s a 30 year fixed).

My income is also decent (6 figures) and after all of the work I put in the last 10 years, I can safely say that I live way below my means. My monthly expenses, including mortgage, credit cards, bills etc total to around half my monthly net pay.

I started maxing out my 401K contributions and put $12K of my savings into my Roth for last year and this year in early Feb to get 2019 and 2020 out of the way.

I also saved up 6 months of living expenses in cash for an emergency fund. I am also incredibly fortunate because I do not anticipate losing my job in the next year, but who knows.

This leaves me with remaining savings in cash in the high 5 figures and this sum in addition to my monthly savings target finally puts me in the position to start planning for my future.

Ideally, I would like to stop working so intensively in about 10 years (I am in a high stress industry) and simplify my life to something I enjoy doing where I can earn 50% of what I earn now to cover my expenses until I retire at 65.

I plan on living modestly into retirement and while I would like to indulge in the occasional luxury like a trip or gadget, I am not looking for much. I do not plan on getting married.

TL;DR: With my situation (no current investments, in my mid-40’s and single, debt free except for mortgage and a nice chunk of cash + steady income stream and savings opps), can any of you offer some advice on where to start? Am I still able to catch up and salvage my financial/retirement future without having to resort to cat food din din's?",ethical investing
gktmtf,fqtnkza,greg_voidman,"What are the concrete ethical benefits to 'ethical investing'? 

My girlfriend has been looking to put some money into index funds/ETFs and likes the idea of choosing an SRI or sustainability-focused fund.  

However, when we have tried to find evidence of the ethical effectiveness of these funds, the articles tend to take the ethical benefit as assumed and instead discuss the financial implications of ethical investing.

Having looked into fossil-fuel divestment, it seems that the economic impact on the affected companies is negligible and main effects are down to stigmatisation. Is this the modus operandi for all ethically focused funds?

Can anyone provide hard evidence of other ethical effects before we ‘put our money where our mouth is’? Or are we just being dumb, and the ethical benefits are just so obvious that people don’t usually need to explicitly state them?

I’ll number the questions so they’re easier to respond to. Thanks so much!

I understand the T+2 settlement period and rules that come with it as applies to a cash account... my understanding is that these rules also apply to margin accounts but a margin account will allow you borrow from your brokerage so as to not use unsettled funds and avoid these violations. (1) Is this presumption correct or do these rules simply only apply to cash accounts? (2) If they do apply to margin accounts, then is a purchase automatically made on margin once the account runs out of settled funds? Say I open the day with $0 cash available for investment, and I sell stock AAA for $1000. Later that same day, a small cap stock BBB that I’ve been watching starts to spike in price and I want in. I know I can buy in with the unsettled funds, but I also know that I’m going to sell the same day since I don’t think it’ll sustain this increase. (3) With a cash account, there’s no way to do this without incurring a GFV, right? (4) And in the same scenario with a margin account, how would I go about making this trade without a GFV...

gvgcnc,fsps6hn,Unlucky-Prize,"Based on your definition of ESG, I think you are going to struggle to find large companies that don't do something you find objectionable, because as corporate activities increase, that possibility increases. Ultimately, we run on a capitalist system, and the functioning of a capitalist system is to maximize capital efficiency, which tends to produce things like paying CEOS a lot of money. It also tends to produce a lot of wealth. Lots of CEOs are delighted to be making tens of millions a year, and also care deeply about humanity and act upon that. Some, like Warren Buffet and Gates, are basically leaving all of their money to charity. Your views are kind of unipolar and don't accept that there are inevitably tradeoffs in any system grounded in the scarcity of the real world. There's no publicly traded company that both lacks some measure of good and bad deeds.  Except for Herbalife. They are just bad.

But to the extent you aren't going to modify your views, I have three suggestions:

First, you could simply go through and take all of the major sectors (it's 11), and for each sector, pick 1-3 companies you think are the best (despite their flaws), and invest. That'll give you vaguely correlated to index performance.  Then, make sure your weighting is proportional to the overall sector weighting. So for example, if you go to Health Care (14.9%), you could decide you like Gilead and Anthem, but don't like J&J or United Health or the rest. Or whatever. You will have to go in knowing you will dislike some of the things they are doing, but also know that you are rewarding the ones that fit your definition of ESG with higher valuations (on the margins, unless you are a multi-billionaire).

Secondly, you could just buy the normal indexes, and donate to causes you feel are worthy to 'offset' the things you don't like making money from.

Thirdly, you could pick sectors where you are less concerned, and accept worse diversification. Real Estate in particular has pretty good internal diversification, and offers a pretty broad set of business models, and tends to be a lot more by the book. There are also some real estate companies that specifically have a business around building out housing inventory in distressed urban areas.",ethical investing

I'm not going to ever invest in a company simply because it has a female CEO. There are female CEOs who are not good (Ginni Rometty at IBM, for example.) There are very good female CEOs (Mandy Ginsberg of Match, Sarah Friar was effectively CEO of Square and should have been made CEO - she was fantastic there, I don't own it but Lisa Su of AMD is another example; there was a great female CEO at INGR who turned the company around and then she left and the stock went South) I'm looking for *good* CEOs, whether they are female or male.

""investing in green companies""

I'm not going to invest in green businesses because they are green. Something I find very irritating is the view that ""it's green and therefore it must be good."" People said ""it's solar so it must be good"" a lot about SunEdison right into bankruptcy.  There were shareholders of that company who spent a ridiculous amount of money on legal fees to create a shareholder committee because they thought the bankruptcy process was being used to ""steal the company from them."" There are letters to the judge that show no comprehension of the possibility that it was a shitty fucking company, but only that it was solar so therefore it was ""saving the planet."" Those people lost twice: they lost on the stock and they lost money on a legal battle there was no way on earth they'd ever win. 

I'm certainly not against investing in green companies, but it has to be something that I feel checks all the boxes that I'd use when looking at anything else and solar panels (for example) just don't do that - there is no moat. So I'm certainly not against, but I definitely don't think that something green is automatically a good business. I look at ""green"" companies like I'd look at anything else and either it checks the boxes and I'll consider investing or it doesn't.

I have started to much more look at workplace reviews in the last year and factored that more into decision making.

""companies with ethical governance""

I don't think people in this era really seem to care that much about strong corporate governance. ESG investing is big absolutely but I really do think that there is a portion of younger people that care a lot about the E and the S but not the G.

Additionally, MSCI certainly continues to see benefit in the growth from ESG but nobody talks about investing in ESG in that sense.

I also think their days are numbered, as soon as wireless high-speed internet or fiber is available, people are going to switch. The technology shift and cord-cutting itself was fueled by their behavior.

In order to invest in a company, I have to believe in something about it-- that could be culture, a product, underlying value, or an industry. For example, more than a meme stock, SPCE represents a real push forward towards a worthy human endeavor (improving technology and developing industry related to space exploration and hypersonic travel). PINS is something I really enjoyed using, though I do not have a current use case for it. NET is part of why DDOS feels like it is no longer a big issue. 

I do not care about enforcing ""diversity"" through my investments-- because it is not my cause and I am not convinced that there is any real benefit.

I think you are exaggerating this a bit. I only saw one comment where you got massively downvoted and lots of people did honestly reply to your post overall.

The one time I did see you catch the major downvotes was because someone pointed out that your overall question is about ethical investing but one of the examples you gave for it was investing in a company just because it has a women CEO, which on it's face isn't ethical or unethical but rather pretty dumb and a bit sexist. You then tried to pivot and argue it falls under personal preference, but that has nothing to do with your original question of ethical investing which is why you were rightfully downvoted in that one instance.

Anyway, answering your actual question, no I don't participate in ethical investing as almost all of my holdings are in broad index funds so I have lots of companies who's overall mission statement/business practices I don't agree with.

e3esa0,f92lrbp,pet_wolverine,"Lots of people involve their morals when investing, and there's nothing specifically ""wrong"" with that.  You could make the argument that investing according to your morals is a financially good strategy, because if everyone ultimately adopts your morals, then you'll be ahead of the game on those investments.  At the same time, you have to make the personal call as to whether you really want to pass on a company that you strongly believe will make you money just because they're doing something you disagree with.  Your call how to make that decision.

Another sticky thing is really choosing those moral companies.  Sure you've got some companies which are really great for the poor or the planet or whatever.  You've got companies making solar, you've got TSLA, you've got organic grocers, formerly Whole Foods (now a part of Amazon), and Sprouts Farmers Market, and others.

But do a deeper dive and things get murky.  TSLA's great for the environment, but I've heard anecdotal things that they're not such a great place to work for.  Maybe that's wrong, I dunno, but what if it's true, would that make them a moral pick or not?  And what about AMZN?  They destroy competition, like mom and pop establishments, they have a history of treating their labor horribly, and they also own Whole Foods.  So good or bad?

Or on the other side of things, Exxon is the devil right?  But they're one of the best managed companies in the world, and actively researching and investing in a plethora of different types of green energy sources.  So...still bad?

If that isn't acceptable you would need to invest yourself which means you can exclude or include whatever you want but you will need to dedicate around 20 hrs per week plus to do this effectively in addition to learning industries, valuation disciplines etc.

The other thing you can look into which in my experience is more debt focused is impact investing. There are a number of firms now doing this in which they only invest in projects that benefit one of the UN  initiatives.

If you'd rather not think about it at all, just put your money in those index funds, and divorce yourself from the responsibility. You can't separate yourself from the modern world of living, so why divorce yourself from the modern world of investing?

Remember, at the end of the day, profit and loss has a certain element of 'zero sum' in it (not actually but I don't want to get into it). For every winner (you hopefully) there is a loser (not you hopefully). There is a reason no one thinks of Warren Buffet as the investor who only invests in Christian companies. He is a pragmatist. There may have been some red lines he wasn't willing to cross, and by all means you can have some too, but you should ultimately be a pragmatist. For example, instead of swearing off of the energy world, maybe look for energy companies that are closer to your moral centre. Yes they exist. It would be like not investing in ARAMCO but instead investing in Husky. Lesser of two evils etc. And there are companies that genuinely care about their legacy and treat their employees well.  Understanding you will never find something perfect, you will nonetheless want exposure to energy (again, an example). The whole modern world runs off of it for, you can't just cut it out with an exacto knife.

The last thing I will say about renewables, yes, they may be the future. Yes, there may be a 20,000% gain company amongst them. But that would be like picking microsoft from amongst the thousands of failed tech companies over the last 30 years. It is extremely hard to do.

Is the word suitable for all age groups? Is this going to be a word which defines a thing or is it more of an acronym?

Jokes aside, I would be extremely cautious about trying to get people to invest their money. I see where you're coming from in that you dont just want people to donate their money because you want them to see a return. However, there is the very real possibility that the companies you choose to invest in will lose money, go bankrupt etc and people may want to hold you accountable.

It sounds like you may be new to this as well, so I would suggest learning about fundemental analysis, learning how to read 10-k, where to find public filings and a company's prospectus. You could also maybe pick up some books about some of the different economic theories and peoples ideas on what makes one company a better company to invest in that another company.

Value investing is a popular choice and aims to find companies who have a strong balance sheet and may be undervalued and will likely be around for a long time
 This is bassically the investment style of warren buffet. 

It also sounds like you and your comrades would like to invest in companies that are moraly upstanding. If this is the case I would read up on the concept of stakeholders in business ethics.

Ethics factor quite heavily into my buying decisions. I don't buy shares of a company if I would be ethically opposed to buying their products. There are a few very lucrative industries I won't touch because I find their business models or products to be morally repugnant.

At some level though, a company's ethical standing is just part of my assessment of their value. Unethical labor and business practices are PR nightmares waiting to happen. Protectionist business models are just a stroke of the legislative pen from bankruptcy.

You could consider subbing some kind of precious metal instead for that purpose, but metals fluctuate in value a lot more than bonds do so there are some downsides.

You might want to consider talking to your faith leader about the ethics of debt. My personal feeling is that exploitative debt is highly immoral, but some kinds of debt - like a family taking out a mortgage to buy a home, or a company issuing bonds to fund an expansion and hire more people - can be a boon to society at large. Because inflation exists, it seems just as immoral to me for people to be paid back in dollars that are worth less at the end of a loan without interest.

My point is that you may be able to find some group of bonds that you are morally comfortable with - for example green bonds are a relatively new thing funding research and expansion in companies working towards environmental stewardship and de-carbonization.

""One retail investor, a retiree named Ken, contacted Business Insider this month to ask whether we knew about the analyst recommendations, which he had seen on E-Trade and which he said helped inform his decision to buy shares of Helios. (Ken requested his last name not be used when discussing his personal finances.)

""I use the analyst research to decide if I am going to buy a stock and after buying it, when to sell,"" Ken told Business Insider. Had the analysts not recommended buy, he said, ""I (and probably others) would not have purchased HMNY, and especially held onto the stock, as the 'buy' recommendation didn't change during the near 100% devaluation.""

According to E-Trade screenshots shared with Business Insider, Ken began to build his stake in March, when the stock was trading at about $4.50. At the time, both Maxim and Canaccord had buy ratings on the stock, with price targets of $16 and $15.

Over the next few months, as the analysts kept their buy ratings and high price targets, Ken put almost $190,000 into Helios, buying hundreds of thousands of shares.

c93rva,essrzba,dvdmovie1,"Many ESG funds are basically a ""product"" and that ""product"" is an easy sell with the message. So many ESG funds it's easy to find companies in the funds one could argue wouldn't fit. I actually wrote to one fund arguing that there's no way a particular company would fit within one of the goals in the fund - they addressed it on the website (apparently I wasn't the only one) but their explanation wasn't particularly good. 

Many ESG funds also just aren't very good, but I think as long as people believe that they are doing something ""green"" or similar that they are going to be more forgiving of the mediocre performance. Additionally, just because something is ""green"" does not guarantee that it will be a good investment - that's something I've said on here for years now. Many people think that ""green"" automatically means a good investment but that simply isn't the case - just because something is green doesn't mean that people don't have to be discerning and do their research as to whether it's a good investment or not.

Lastly, something might not be 100% sustainable (I think trying to find something 100% is going to be severely limiting to your universe of possible investments), but look at something like Ecolab (ECL), which is the largest hygiene/sanitation company. It's not sexy, it's not exciting, but it's something that many companies need day in/day out and therefore, there's a lot of recurring revenue. They are also helping customers with tasks like reducing water use. Bill Gates owns about 12%.  

A company like Waste Management is consistently improving their recycling process and innovating with things like using landfill gas (https://www.wm.com/sustainability/renewable-energy.jsp; ""At about 130 disposal sites, we use naturally-occurring landfill gas to power homes and businesses. Just recently, we even developed the technology to convert landfill gas into a fuel our fleet vehicles can run on."")  Again, not a sexy business but the idea being they can do more and more each year with the waste that they get every day.

ESG indexes generally work on an exclusion basis, they take the whole market and then throw out companies they feel are problematic.

It seems for example from their top holdings that they broadly consider big tech, finance and communications to be less involved in activities that would impact on animals.

dcuv62,f2c6ylq,Ry-Fi,"Very good write up.

A few notes I would add:
1) Capex is coming down significantly going forward per Management's comments on the Q2 call. They also have an unprofitable lease expiring that will result in ~$10MM of annual cash flow savings beginning in 2020. Both of these should enhance FCF in the coming years.

2) Big risks for GEO are 1) refi risk and 2) political risk. Most banks have exited the private prison space, thus it calls into question who is left to lead a bond deal and/or capital raise for them to replace their debt facilities as they come due. CoreCivic has a bond maturing in Q1 2020 which will be a good test to see if they can convince a financial institution to lead a deal for them. More likely than not they will fund the redemption via their revolver. That's obviously less than ideal. Secondary levels for GEO's debt also suggest their cost of capital is going to go be going WAYYYY higher in the future.

Political risk is largely self explanatory, but all the major Democratic nominees sans Biden (I believe) want to do away with private prisons. This is largely just talk as doing so in reality would be incredibly difficult to do, but none the less it remains a material risk if the BoP and various Federal agencies were directed to relocate these beds to government run facilities. Such a process seems highly improbable when you look at the numbers, but could be achieved over time, albeit slowly, giving GEO sufficient time to adapt. Revenue at immediate risk, however, is their managed only contracts.

3 )That said GEO is over levered going into the political cycle. They will frantically attempt to de-lever in preparation for 2020, but it never should have come to this. They burned way too much cash on share repurchases recently which they funded under their RC and are now working to correct this mistake. Not only was it dumb to lever the balance sheet right before a political cycle, their stock is trading significantly lower than it was during the time of the repurchases.",ethical investing
dcuv62,f2cefqi,unjust_laws,"Some additional points:

1) Incarceration rates (sans immigration) are decreasing

2) I think its like a third of all inmates are drug related and city after city are making some drugs (pot) legal

3) Cameras are everywhere - cellphone, doorbell, street cameras - with geolocation are likely to document crime, which might make it less likely

vs

4) Additional laws are increasing (we still have 3 strikes laws), there is no real push to remove old laws

5) Recession might yield increase of crime - but its not guaranteed

6) Cellphones, cameras, street cameras, doorbell cameras document crime, making convictions easier

7) once you have a criminal record, your chance of recidivism is more than 50%; in a weak economy, it is likely you will be passed over by someone who doesnt have a rapsheet

8) Social programs are being cut.  Many times due to pension crisis in city budgets. Mental patients are shuffled to street and become part of the system as no saftey net exists.  

9) like 8) ""Brooks was here"" - in prison, you get a bed, food, and medical care.  So hold up a bank, and live out your retirement years behind bars.  Laugh now, I see this becoming a more viable strategy as retirement wont cover the cost of living.

10) Its ""cheaper"" in terms of fringe benefits/government pay to shift to private prisons.  I have read studies that say that is not true, but most cash strapped governments dont have the credit to build new - its better to lease (aka, kick the can down the road)


My opinion, for what it is worth, is kinda dark.

I see this as a shitty system in general, but, a growth industry for the reasons above.  

Politicians can piss and moan and everyone can be angry about ""for profit"" prisons.  We have for profit health care, and for profit insurance, and for profit car companies, and for profit food companies.  USA is capitalist.  I guess, i expect for profit to be the norm.

I believe some of them think of it in terms of ""I don't want to support X company by giving them my $"", but when you buy shares from an exchange, the money is going to another investor who happens to be selling. The company does not receive the $ from your stock purchase. Certainly the company could be buying shares back, but the vast majority of time you're just buying shares from another investor.

It does help the company though as some have said regarding lowering their financing costs (as their stock goes up) and allows them to get more $ if they do an additional offering, but it hurts them if they're doing a buyback (they want share prices down when doing buy backs). Practically your purchases aren't going to move the price of anything aside from penny stocks.

Personally I think ethical investing is not an optimal way to put your money to work for or against a particular cause. As an investor you should be looking to maximize your profits. Again, the company isn't getting your $ when you buy their shares. Make as much as you can and donate to what you like. Oh the irony of profiting from a rise in Tyson while donating (a portion of) profits to an animal rights group. Tyson doesn't get your $, so you didn't help them, but you did fund their opposition.

But you still should find a way to afford the max.  If they let you sell immediately, then 10% of 3 months pay should be small enough to tie up easily, and near zero risk.

You have misunderstood the interaction between holding time and taxes.  The tax savings is less than you seem to think and the holding period to get that savings longer (21 months, for your plan, not 12) and in some quarters holding that long increases taxes rather than reducing them.

Probably you should sell as soon as permitted, immediately if that is permitted.  That is especially true if holding longer would push you to participating at less than the max permitted %.

If you do not, then you would simply not invest, even with the 15% discount.

Further, you say it pays a dividend. Sweet. You should be expecting some payments quarterly or annually (however they do it)! You could even DRIP those babies and try and snowball that motherfkr using compounding interest and start gaining more money.

Now to your question: should I invest and how should I cash out.

First off, I would look as the ESPP as a long term investment. So don't even think less than a year; think 3+. Analyze your company a bit and determine if you believe the company is at its market worth, or do you believe it is under/over-vauled. If you believe it is over-valued then don't invest. If it is under-valued and you have 15% discount and you get dividend and you DRIP that shit, then maximize the fk out of it. Fk diversification. If you know you got a solid hand with not that much downside, then why not put as many chips in? This is one of those life bets. And if you want the biggest payout, you got to take on more risk in some way, shape, or form. 

Just what I think anyway. But you just got to know what your risk tolerance is. Also ask yourself how well do you actually know the company and why you believe in it so much. Having first hand insight is pretty dope. But maybe you only know your part of the company's business. The reason for these programs is to try and align workers motivation/productivity with the company's through ownership and profit-sharing. 

When it comes to cashing out in the long term, you basically have to monitor the health of the company and its ability to meet your expectations. You can set any parameters for this. Again, it's all up to your risk tolerance.

I'll invest in oil and natural gas exploration and production because, despite the environmental concerns, I have to live in the world, and we currently get our energy how we get it, and fossil fuels are part of that, and will continue to be.

Independent fee-only financial advisors who support the best interests of their clients exist -- I met quite a few of them through my MBA capstone project, which was consulting in the financial services industry. I can't say if such firms were 100% in index funds, but they were advertising portfolio returns as only one of many planning, tax, etc services they offered.

If you're not working for a major firm who's paying commissions for you to sell products, then the primary value you give to your clients is keeping someone knowledgeable in between them and their investments so they don't panic and do stupid stuff with their money during market swings without someone stopping them. The assets themselves being in index funds -- when you said it yourself, clients may not even know what index funds are -- doesn't change that value proposition at all.

You can calculate it yourself to see if the finances work out. A 1% management fee with an average client asset value of 100k means that you'll need 70 clients to reach 70k in revenue. You can definitely beat a 100k average if you pick up some wealthy clients or folks who have already saved a lot for retirement.

I think some people are being a little snarky here because your treatise here only accomplishes the very easiest part of the process. Yes indexing is better and yes you can make money as a fee-only advisor. Now you need to research the industry like crazy and look into what it will take to get the Series 65 license (and preferably the CFP) as well as things like omissions and errors insurance, business licensing, purchasing books of clients, and custodial firms.

Alternatively/also, you should see if there are any fee-only firms in your area that meet your description (I guarantee you there are some if you live in a major city) through web searching or networking through the FPA or something, and possibly see if they'd be willing to take you on as an associate advisor. Being in someone else's firm without having to set up the business from scratch, and possible getting in line to succeed them and handle their clients after they retire, is a very attractive option for someone just starting out.

Then inferred ocean acidification will affect yield decrease (common knowledge ocean acidification will impact rain water, which will affect yield globally because the more acidic water is, the more chances roots will be oxidized and hurt the plant's growth quantity of fruits and size of vegetables).

From my perspective it is still very uncertain if companies/funds in general will benefit at all across the world. 

Foreign/Domestic Imports will increase in Pacific coast states + inland west and prices of fruits/vegetables in California will go up. Suppliers may face a negative demand shock if prices increase too rapidly.

At the same time suppliers/retailers will also face with a negative supply shock, because there won't be the yield enough to make fruits or vegetables to sell at friendly price to break even.

Seed suppliers will also be hurt because agriculture suppliers will respond to the market (if weather misfortune continues) by buying less seeds.

1.) They'll be actively trading in this account, charging 25bps for the account fees, and 1% to manage.

2.) These products are exactly what they say they are: Capped.  These are unsecured debt securities linked to an index (potentially S&P 500), and limit your upside. They cap your downside as well, but you're essentially paying 80bps for 2x levered equity index in the form of debt.  Unlevered would not even make sense either.

j4qrqb,g7svk51,phikapp1932,"There are so many things wrong with your information on renewables and the comparison of gas to EV motors.

- Gasoline has a lot more energy density, that’s true. But that’s a flash-in-the-pan statement, because literally any machine we’ve built to use gasoline as fuel can’t top 30% efficiency, and that’s REALLY good for an engine. Your gas car, on a hot summer day, probably sits around 25% efficiency, while in the cold probably has a measly 15% efficiency. Meanwhile, lithium batteries have a 90% energy conversion efficiency, and their charge is constant until close to 0% state of charge (SoC). The first point is trivial, because an L-ion battery only needs about a third of the energy density as gasoline to perform as well as a fuel. That second point is why L-Ion batteries have seen such a meteoric rise - their SoC capabilities and stability are unmatched compared to any other battery tech we have seen. The only problem, as you mentioned, is thermal runaway, which can easily be controlled through a battery management system. These systems measure the voltage, current, temperature, and SoC of every individual cell, regulates their output, and shuts them off if anything seems remotely off. Many companies, including TSLA, have BMS tech out there, which brings me to my next point:

- TSLA is far more than an automotive manufacturing company. The reason why they’re such a threat is because they pour resources into RnD like none other. This is one of the main reasons TSLA went negative for like 8 years straight. They literally mine, forge, cold-roll, and manufacture their own steel, and insert an additive that gives it more tensile strength while reducing weight. That is something that automakers cannot figure out, mostly because they buy their sheet metal and other raw materials from other companies. TSLA also creates their own battery tech, BMS, and patented their own in-line thermal fuses. That third point doesn’t sound like a lot, but from an engineering standpoint is incredible difficult; the in-line fuses they created are copper wires thin enough that if the current exceeds that of the maximum power their LI batteries can output (I.e. short-circuit or thermal runaway), the copper wire heats up and melts, breaking the connection to the rest of the batteries. The level of manufacturing precision to make those fuses reliable to the sixth Sigma is incredible in itself. Their batteries have some of the highest energy densities of batteries out there. The software they’ve written is high above any other automotive software. They might be hyped up, but I don’t believe they’re overvalued given the advances in material science they’ve contributed. And, TSLA is part way solving the energy storage crisis that you y’all about for renewables, which brings me to my next point:

- solar panels. You claim they’re too expensive to become profitable, and that they have problems with maintaining their efficiency. While it may be partly true, I’ve run many models of residential and commercial solar panel systems, and with a standard 8-10% efficiency, most systems become profitable within a decade. While that may seem like a load of shit to residential customers, commercial customers should be all over it. No, there hasn’t been a breakthrough in solar efficiency in a while, but you have missed several breakthroughs in manufacturability. The cost-per-watt model is commonly used to grade a solar panel’s practicality, and standard silicone solar panels have decreased their $/W by 90% since they first hit the market. And their shelf life is about 30 years, with solar efficiency staying relatively constant through that period. So 10 years to become profitable, 30 years until I have to get new ones, and for a commercial investor it really isn’t that expensive to convert....seems like a profit to me. Of course, there’s areas where solar won’t work, but why would we be talking about those places in the first place? The final problem is energy storage, which I’ve said is being solved as we speak, and really already isn’t a problem if designed correctly. 

TL;DR, not in a bubble, tech is there, OP needs to read a few ScienceDirect articles.

Pretty bearish, but not necessarily means that we will crash tomorrow - 15M & 5M RSI is oversold. Whatever happens the next few days - whether or not 1D MACD crosses over, which requires SPY 300 to not and > 316 to do so, will set the trend for the next month.

hhrkwu,fx418iq,ASoftEngStudent,"7/6 12PM - We gapped up above the resistance. From a technical level, this is heavily bullish and indicates that we're headed to ATH. From a fundamental level (i.e. corona cases, economic), this seems unlikely. Most likely scenario would be a fake-out and reversal within the next few days. Not doing any active trading anymore and sitting all on VIX calls. Good thing about the VIX calls I entered @ 26 is that it'll be very difficult for it to go much more below that level - VIX is still hovering above 28 despite the gap up, since institutions are also going into this gap up with alot of skepticism and hedging their longs, which is what VIX effectively measures.",ethical investing

hhrkwu,fwbxrnz,Reeeetail_Investor,Read this nonsense recently. Only smooth brains put any stock into what Dalio is selling these days. I checked his 13F and Bridgewater has considerable exposure to Chinese ETFs and equities. Methinks he's trying to pump up investor appetite in China. He hasn't really seen the real China otherwise he wouldn't think they have the resources to challenge the supremacy of the US as the world order. Or he has and he's a shill.,ethical investing
hhrkwu,fwcl6w4,seattle_exile,"> For most of history, China was the leading power in the world, up until the 1600s. The Dutch, starting in the 1600s, became a rich global empire, before being overtaken by the British in the late 1700s, and the United States in the early 1900s.

This is a terrible reading of history. There is so much wrong with it, it’s hard to know where to begin. Let’s just call out the big ones:

* Historically, “China” is a fractious state that has never been held together as one entity for more than a few hundred years at a time. The last folks to do so were the Mongols. This is primarily due to geography. It has *never* been a world power until the 20th century. Before the modern era, all trade with China was performed via the Silk Road or the long-way-round shipping routes developed by the Portuguese or Spanish.

* Speaking of the Portuguese and Spanish, they dominated world trade in the 16th century.

* And what about the French? They had a pretty good run there too, during the 17th century.

* You know who wasn’t a superpower? The Dutch. They were fantastic at trade because they kept religion out of it, but they were never anywhere as powerful as the other states in Europe.

The United States is geographically unique, and it plays into the long term prospects of our success. We can produce anything we want domestically, and that includes oil now. We engage in world trade because of economies of efficiency. We don’t have rival states nearby to adjust our borders and pick up the mantle. A collapse would only analogue the fall of Rome: a vacuum of administration. 

The second to last thing the world wants is to lose the United States as a market. The first last thing they want is for us to stop securing the shipping lanes. I’m afraid both are in the near future. China would like to take our place, but they will have an even harder time securing Middle-Eastern oil than we did.",ethical investing

China is at a big disadvantage compared to the United States. They are the producers of goods while we are their main consumer of goods. By applying tariffs on goods, we are promoting the transfer of manufacturing from one country to another. 

The reason we as a nation became so reliant on Chinese goods is because of very low wages. China has developed into a first world country. 

You may ask, what does that have to do with anything? Well, the U.S. likes to use resources for all means of sustains growth. India will be next country which will increasingly benefit from manufacturing shift from China. The U.S. will pump the brakes on China very soon. India will be the next country to morph from a third world country into an economic powerhouse. 

China in turn will lead to a decline in manufacturing and level out in regards to expansion. One threat still exists today and that’s when a country and it’s superiority are being threatened. War looms in the horizon, as China will not be sitting down as this shift occurs.

CNN did an article recently (last week) Basically, the united nations decided to place the research center in Indonesia. The picked this because they wanted a faster way to get more patients while still being in critical areas. As a part of the agreement, Indonesia is being sent free items such as masks, soap, etc. The main thing about the agreement is if they find a good vaccine then Indonesia will be the first to use it and the first to sell the right to produce the vaccine.

Let's take $BYND as an example.  Firstly, no one seemed to know exactly when it would IPO, even up to the days beforehand. Wtf, isn't this supposed to be planned a bit?  Secondly, let's say you're trying to get into the IPO with an investment firm that isn't directly involved/underwriting it.  In my case, TDAmeritrade.  I gave them a call and they said to place a limit order, and if it IPO'd at the right price my order would be filled.

A few problems though: 1. I couldn't find out how to place it.  The BYND ticker was not accepted by their platform.  Did some research, maybe I need to be authenticated as a special class of investor with [#Min] available funds or something?  2. In what order are buy orders filled?  If there are tons of eager investors all ready to buy at market price at the time of the opening bell, whose orders get filled first?  I think this could just be basic order filling - whoever gets on the books first?

Basically just logistics of how to buy IPOs as a single investor with my slush fund on TDAmeritrade, and how the stock becomes available/distributed to the waiting market on the 1st day.",ethical investing

**ANALYSTS' RECOMMENDATION**

• Domino's Pizza Inc (DPZ). Barclays cuts target price to $255 from $262 after the company reported third-quarter results below
expectations amidst intensifying competition from Pizza Hut and other food delivery upstarts.

• J&J (JNJ). Credit Suisse raises target price to $152 from $149 following the company’s strong third-quarter results driven by rising
sales of its cancer drugs Zytiga and Darzalex.

• Morgan Stanley (MS). Evercore ISI cuts target price to $58 from $62 citing weak revenue growth in the company’s investment
banking segment in the third-quarter.

• UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH): Jefferies raises target price to $315 from $311 citing the company’s assessment on continued 13-
16 percent growth in earnings per share in 2019.

On patents; patents are supposed to encourage competition; if you don't have intellectual property rights, then people don't have a financial incentive to share their discoveries.

Additionally, I think the ire against healthcare (e.g. Mylan, etc.) has been misplaced. I think it's true that we probably spend too much on drugs; but I think it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare system is flawed; there doesn't seem to be a proper reward for preventative care. The healthcare industry benefits too much from more harm done, because they bill per service/drug.

I recently had a discussion with a investor at a big pension investor firm ( in The Netherlands, pensions of different funds, based on industry, are invested by 2 corporations). 

We talked about the morality of investing policy, where he believed their moral duty was to ensure good pensions for people who worked hard their entire lives, and my point of view was that this was no excuses to defend unethical investments ( we mentioned Aramco and Shell specifically in this discussion). 

Something that made the whole discussion quite interesting was discussing policy and making exceptions to policy. So for example policy choice is not investing in arms, even if that leads to lower returns. Whereas excluding Aramco based on the fact that it is an oil company and more questionable factors, would be an exception to policy and would be a decision based on public opinion.

None of them regretted their decision to quit. I can’t say much about my own decision to leave but it was caused in large part by the reality that I was working on deals which enabled a particular nation to stay afloat financially while it massacred its own civilians. My role in the grand scheme might’ve been small but I was directly helping a country to murder innocent people. So I left. Another friend left because he discovered the “rescue package” he helped create was later used to turn a major river into an industrial dumping ground that caused hundreds of fishermen to lose their entire livelihood.

Many people lose their home and eventually commit suicide - look at the Enron scandal; hundreds of people lost their whole world. Millions lost everything in the 2008+ housing bubble con.

What do you think will have a bigger impact on Exxon?  You not owning the tiniest fraction of their already issued stock or you not purchasing gasoline?

Example:

I am not a fan of Walmart's business practices.  As such, I refuse to spend my money at Walmart.  This means that they will never increase their profits/influence from my money.  However, if I go to a garage sale and find a used item that I want to own, it doesn't matter to me if it was originally purchased at Walmart or not.  If it's a good price and fits my needs, I'll buy it.

In the same manner, buying stock on the secondary market basically has zero effect on the company that issued it originally.  You're buying it from another investor, not the company directly.  If you're worried about these things, you can do *way* more effective actions than sabotage your financial future while having exactly zero influence on these companies.

But they're going to do that anyway, my attempting to avoid index funds that contain companies I don't approve of the behavior of, wouldn't change anything other than make it pretty darn impossible for me to invest in index funds. 

Better to invest the money, as NOVACPA says, and then use the money to fund organizations that *do* work to prevent it. Extra bonus fact: donating appreciated stock is a pretty powerful way to get nice tax breaks, if you were going to donate anyway. (You can donate, avoid paying taxes on the capital gains, *and* deduct the full amount the stock was worth when you sold it - then immediately rebuy the same stock at the new price. :) I learned that a few weeks ago, and am totally planning on donating a decent chunk of Tesla stock to the ACLU, as soon as I get around to it.)",ethical investing

There is absolutely nothing you can do, not to sound cynical but its just the way it is. Someone else is going to come and take your place, especially with regular people even if they have millions of dollars, it is nothing but a drop in the bucket(if even that) on the grand scale.

One more thing: Would companies like Apple and Nike be ethical investments with their cheap slave labor overseas? Or McDonalds with their food that's probably caused serious health problems over the years?

The [growth of ETFs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/etfs-shattered-their-growth-records-in-2017-2017-12-11) over the past couple of years has been flabbergasting. Investment managers have seen there is real money in collating a group of investment specific stocks that is diversified (within a sector) and can be flexibility bought and sold like a stock. The growth of ""environmentally friendly"" ETFs has seen a similar trend.    


However, similar to diversity and inclusion ratings for large companies that published by different companies these sustainable ETFs are just created using ratings on a set of arbitrary metrics chosen by some manager.  There could be many ""sustainable companies"" that that score high on a sustainability index but still do net harm to the environment or society. Think paper company that plants replacement trees at a slower rate than they chop them down.  With most of these socially responsibile funds I think all that is bought is really just a good feeling and lower returns.   


I might consider re-framing things.  For example, could you invest in whatever funds help you meet your financial goals and then through your greater returns, FI etc have the funds you need to give more generously to whatever cause means the most to you. So maximizing your ""good"" through direct investments into causes in your local community  vs. minimizing your ""bad"" via remote investments that are purportedly ""sustainable""? ",ethical investing
b27sfu,eiqznx2,ElephantsAreHeavy,"Personally, instead of buying the indexes or ETF's blindly, I look at their composition. I look at the relative weight of the company, its sector and its mission statement. I have an underrepresentation of financial stocks (I don't trust them too much), an underrepresentation of unsustainable development, no oil companies, no tobacco companies. Only a little bit of FAANG in SP500 ETF's, but their working conditions and business model is not something I support and want to invest in (especially A&A). 

What I however not do, is investing in small wind/solar/wave energy startups etc... I think it is too risky.

What I do is also living a more sustainable life. I look at my consumption, I spend more money on a car that is having no local emission, I buy more expensive home appliances that consume less electricity.

When it comes to the environment, individual impact is limited, but collectively we can do something. On this forum, people have sufficient money to try and not make the problem worse. For me it is worth it to have lower gains on my investments if this makes the world a better place. Not only less carbondioxide, but also less plastic waste, less slavery, less unethical crap. Capitalism can survive in these conditions. ",ethical investing

I will concede that you could be helping to boost the price on something that contributes to executive pay which may not be an influence that you want to have, but again we are talking about minuscule influences on price. The market doesn’t care about any of our personal ethics or politics. If anyone feels strongly about avoiding oil stocks, sell the car and ride a bike instead.

* There are also things like the Aspiration Mutual Fund, which tried to invest responsibly, lets you set the fee structure, and then lets you donate a portion of the profits to charities. 

If you look at the holdings in any of those, you still see a ton of the usual suspects (e.g., Apple, VMware, J&J, HomeDepot), so it is more about minor improvements over any kind of radical difference.   I guess there are pros and cons to that.  I guess if they got big enough it could slowly influence some companies. Seems like these are slowly starting to gain some traction. 

I'm a fan of SPYX, which seeks to track the S&P 500 but eliminates companies that own fossil fuel reserves from the S&P 500, both for environmental and investing purposes.

To answer the question, “what does your race and sexuality have to do with your story?,” it doesn’t. That’s the point. I’m a black gay male, but was still able to save, invest, level up in my career, and dream big. Even in my write-up, aside from the title and the ***Things that Didn’t Prove True for Me*** section***,*** my race and sexuality don’t come up and that was not by coincidence. That was because my race and sexuality didn’t play a role in my ability to achieve.

However, what a lot of you are missing is that while I personally haven’t been discriminated against in my career (thus far), there are black and gay people who are discriminated against ***regularly***, either in their career or everyday life. There is a psychological impact that discrimination can have on a person’s confidence, perception of self-worth, and outlook on life.  Discrimination and bias in the work place also have a direct impact on your career progression and earning potential and ability to level up in your career (e.g. being passed over senior roles that may have a high earning potential). Representation is important and telling my story can help show that while the journey can be hard, it can be done. My story can potentially impact those with overlapping demographics to inspire them to keep at it  — and that possibility in itself is worth sharing, which was the main inspiration behind this write-up.  I urge those who asked me this question to practice self-awareness and think outside of your own bubble as that can go a long way to building empathy.

As I didn’t start investing until March 2019, I missed out on some decent gains. ""

Yes, but that's only in hindsight, the market could have also gone down during that time and you could have been worse off.   So don't feel too sad about it.  Hell, you could have put $1k in bitcoin in 2014 and sold in 2017 but you didn't, and you didn't want to take high risks so that's all OK. 

&#x200B;

""  I often see comments like “you’re doing better than X% of the USA, the world, or your demographic” and they mean absolute nothing to me.  ""

&#x200B;

I think it's nice to recognize that we are ""very well off"" compared to other people on this planet.  But that doesn't mean you need to change anything that you're doing.  When I hit ""top 10% of the US, aka, top 1% (or is it .1%?) of the world"", I didn't feel any richer because I'm still in a HCOL area where most of my money goes to living expenses.

&#x200B;

"" While I worked hard, lived with intention, and had a vision to get where I’m at today, I 100% acknowledge that external factors (e.g. graduating during an economic expansion and not a recession, currently working at a company that hasn’t made layoffs, etc.) played a pivotal role in my success as well.  ""

I think it takes a strong rational mind to recognize that a lot of your success in life is just the result of random luck.  There's only so much you can control in your life.  But you can celebrate your success nevertheless.",ethical investing

My wife and I moved to a much cheaper apartment than what we can afford (3.5% of our pretax base salary) and we drive this 8 year old kia with the bumper literally falling off with tape on it.

i9x3r5,g1kmvrj,MrGr33n31,">Firstly, I didn’t start investing (excl. 401k) until 2019 despite starting my career in 2014. In the early stages of my career, I was primarily saving cash as my goal at the time was to save for a down payment for a house for my late twenties/early thirties. In hindsight, even with that goal, I should’ve still been active in the stock market as my time horizon was far enough out (8+ years). Between June 2014 and February 2019 — the time I was out of the market — [the S&P500 grew \~46% with dividends reinvested and accounting for inflation](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/). As I didn’t start investing until March 2019, I missed out on some decent gains. My portfolio would probably be $100k higher (give or take) had I been in the market consistently since 2014.

I think it might be a mistake to regard this experience as this much of a mistake. It seems too results-oriented.

Sure, in the timeline we lived in S&P saw a steep increase from 2014-19 and we didn't see any sort of sudden housing crash that would have allowed the money you saved to be suddenly useful for a down payment. But just because we experienced this particular timeline doesn't mean your decision necessarily had to be so wrong...if in 2017 you decided to move to a lower COL area based on a previously unforeseen career opportunity and came upon a great RE listing during a sudden drop in both housing and the stock market then I'm sure you would have been glad to have the cash available to make a good offer. The version of yourself in that timeline might be posting about the $130k gained in equity and rent in three short years all because you had the cash on hand to make a good deal when the opportunity presented itself. In the majority of timelines you're probably better off with some level of activity in the stock market, but there are a few timelines in which your actual approach would have worked out fine.

Also, just because the stock market has been great doesn't necessarily mean that you would have been able to make good bets as an inexperienced investor. I can understand how the 2014 version of yourself might have been concerned with that and saw saving cash as the safest option with the 2008 crash in recent memory. When you mention the possibility of your portfolio being $100k higher, are you basing that on buying index funds through dollar cost averaging over that five year period? I agree that would be a safe enough approach to be comfortable for a new investor.",ethical investing

I often see comments like “you’re doing better than X% of the USA, the world, or your demographic” and they mean absolute nothing to me. My goals are my goals — they’re not impacted or influenced by others, regardless if I’m at the bottom or top of the pack for my demographic.

I’m not going to change my strategy or alter my confidence because I’m outpacing someone or someone is outpacing me.

This really stuck out to be. I think growing up in the US, we're taught that it has to be a 0 sum game. Where one person has to win and the other has to lose. Maybe I'm a bit naive with this type of optimism, but I think we need less of this in the world.

i9x3r5,g1kd96l,MrGr33n31,">America is truly the land of opportunity. While America is not perfect (no country is), I sincerely appreciate America for the opportunities it has provided me to elevate and make something of my life. It amazes me how starkly I’ve been able to turn my life around from youth to present. I appreciate this country deeply.

On one hand, I do agree that there are opportunities here (particularly for entrepreneurs) that would not be possible in other places because of regulations. I know that I have been able to build some wealth in real estate investing that would have been more difficult to secure in many European countries and even Canada. On the other hand, I would argue that for most people earning W2 income the opportunity to be compensated generously and then build financial independence might not be all that great in America.

Your work has been analytics and consulting and you have both the intelligence and passion to do well in these fields. That particular skill set has provided you an opportunity to rise from a low income household to high net worth, and that's great. I'm genuinely happy to hear things have worked out that way. However, what if you had an equal level of talent and passion toward a field like history and were only able to secure an adjunct position that payed $18,000 after you earned your PhD? What if your talent and passion pointed you toward work that could only be performed in the government and you later found out that the maximum salary for a first year employee with five years military experience at your agency was $67,000 in a VHCOL city without opportunities to quickly promote into six figures? My point is that you are the exception to the rule in three ways. One way is the career timing that you mention, the second way is your level of talent, and the third way is the career field that utilizes that level of talent. Having all three of these factors going for you at once presents you with opportunities that simply aren't in the realm of possibility for the vast majority of people.

Your experience is your experience, and I certainly don't want to make an argument to suggest that you are not perceiving your own situation accurately. I just want to say that when examining America in general, I don't think it's true to say it is a land of opportunity for most of the people in our generation. Many are coming out of school with crushing debt to work in jobs that haven't seen wage growth in 40 years. According to this source, we rank 27th in the world in social mobility while the northern European countries hold the #1 through # 6 rankings.

I am extremely fortunate given my own demographics to have also ""made it"", but I certainly recognize that I had some wonderful foundations I was born into (white, middle-class-ish, only child, lot of experiences as a kid, ability to financially afford college, lucked out in first job in career, etc etc). I don't know about having any of my own children, but philanthropic work to help queer youth is one of the things I do care intensely about. I can only be the person I am today due to the incredible work, struggles, and sacrifices of those who came before me. 

I'm fortunate as hell to have my ""queerness"" be an asset in my life, not a liability. That is unfortunately not the case for many and I can hopefully help pave an easier path for those who come after me.

*edit*: I'll also note, that while I very much feel I have ""made it"" and am likely setup for life by nature of where I'm at currently, I also have a persistent anxiety and fear that I'm only one step away from losing it all. That if I make a mistake, or otherwise have flaws, that it'll undermine my ability to succeed and take all that I've done to this point away. As a queer woman in a very cishet white male space of tech, I'm feel that I will turn a metaphorical corner and be forced out of this space.

Think about it -- if someone gave you more money than you can reasonably use, will you still work? My guess is yes. So the answer I think is you will never have ""enough"", since money was never your goal in the first place.

iy3xsh,g6ainih,JacobAldridge,"Firstly, congrats!

Speaking for myself (38M, the only person I'm qualified to speak for), it's been surprising over the past 18 months how my focus has finally shifted away from 'what can I do to make more?'. I've basically been working part-time, and actually making as much or more as I did before anyway.

What changed? We had our first kid (and also spent most of last year travelling the world). Now, I'm not proposing impregnation as the solution, but rather a specific tool / exercise that might help - https://personalexcellence.co/blog/life-wheel/

The 'Wheel of Life' is a fairly cliched self-development tool by this point, but I still find it useful from time-to-time. The one I linked has 10 areas of your life, and asks you to rate yourself on all 10. Happiness (so the theory goes) will drop to the level of whichever is lowest - so your finances and career may be 10-out-of-10 but if your family / social life / recreation is a 2-out-of-10 then you'll feel like a 2-out-of-10.

Key point: score each category ""relative to self"". It's about how you feel that area of your life is going, relative to how you want that to be going. It's not a comparison game - you make more money than many and less money than many others, so comparisons are pointless.

Fill it out and see what you learn! 

Then remember it will change over time, as your life and dreams evolve. I'm doing the same amount of diet and exercise now that I did at 29 (ie, not much), but my Health score is definitely lower today because I'm more mindful of how that impacts me. The same goes (up or down) for all the other categories.",ethical investing

I got sick of trading hours to earn money to spend on things I enjoy doing, so I created my own job and now everything is awesome and there's no element of escapism anywhere.

I sometimes feel like I'd rather go the other direction and pull a Jerry McGuire: less work, less money, more years, and more happiness (with less stress).  

I'm pretty happy with the balance I have with work, family, and kids. We don't have to watch each dollar too closely.

It's all about where do you find fulfillment.  If it's just in making money, then I'd recommend you can look at other means like volunteering your skills or time to help some other people.  You may find a couple of things, maybe you love volunteering and the sense of accomplishment with it.  Maybe you hate it and realize that's not your ""enough.""

My Fat FI level is the replacement level on a ""high income job"" for which I use big law starting salary around $190k as a benchmark, which would be around $130k after tax, x 25, or about $3.25M, plus paid off house.  Above that I just can't see how money would really do anything to add anything to my life.  Could I spend more?  Sure.

As you get older, life will throw differing perspectives at you which you'll continue to adjust to.  The concept of 'enough' changes in currency from money to relationships to health, etc etc.  The currency of youth (IMO) is monetary because you generally have your health and you may have figured out a portion of your relationships.  As you move into your 30s and 40s, money maintains a strong currency but relationships (marriage, kids) becomes more relevant and grows stronger in stature.  Once you're in your 40's and 50's, the currency shifts more towards health and relationships, particularly as you start losing people in your life like parents, grandparents and (unfortunately) peers/friends.  Money starts to lose its weight at this point as you're in peak earnings years and if you've saved properly, you're likely FI, maybe even RE.

Then $50k. Now I'm saving >$60k/year, and with a recent promotion might even be able to push that to >$80k (depending on bonus and profit sharing). 

Still, it never feels like enough. The goalpost is always shifting and I feel like the main reason for this is ***not being FI yet***. If you save $10k/year or $100k/year, if you still aren't FI, you aren't FI. In both cases you still have to work. Granted, one will obviously accelerate your retirement faster than the other. So my theory is that ever-increasing savings is only satisfying until you actually hit FI, because the quantity of your savings starts to matter less - you can quit whenever you want.

 I agree that even on lean fire, you should have a lifestyle that is worst than the one you want to have once you reach FIRE. Its silly imho (to an extent, of course theres a little room to wiggle those numbers)

&#x200B;

So, in short (Congratulations first), not that many people is able to fatfire, and some are unlucky enough to never reach full fire and have to leanfire (im not talking about the ones doing it on purpose). I think in those cases how you move between your FIRE life is probably a bit more complicated or ""bussy"", But I had not even started my FIRE journey so I may be wrong.

 Again, congratulations! It seems you are coping very well with ""retirement-depression"" (some people get it, others dont) and you are organizing accordingly very well. With that amount of fat fire (Depending of what you want to do it may never be ""thats enough"" imho) i would certianly try jobs not as financially rewarding, perhaps open a business or something and try my luck

I fail to see how ""diversity measures"" at a corporate level are a good thing. If you are forcing companies to hire less qualified people due to their gender, sexuality, or skin color, everyone ultimately loses. 

>Have you found ways to invest in companies that align well with your morals

As a retail investor, if you want to be moral, take profits of all those unethical companies and then put that money towards some of your goals. You'll have way more impact this way. There's no mutual fund that will 100% align with your views, and it even if you were willing to do something like directly buy shares S&P500 companies excluding those you don't like, the time and effort it would take to research all those companies to exclude bad ones would be better spent elsewhere.",ethical investing

f60ahr,fi1zvz2,Hatunike,"This is a great question. Lots of companies I'd morally disagree with are in the S&P 500. 

But I've never really had a hard time morally investing in broad index funds. Now that I give it a bit more of my thinking, I'm not entirely sure why I'm so very much ok with it.

Perhaps its because my vote in the entire market is a vote of optimism and faith that the good companies will rise and the less ethical companies will go out of business. I think that this is particularly true in long term investing.

Perhaps it's similar to how anyone that defends our freedoms (Military Service) doesn't just defend the freedoms of the good people, but everyone. A belief in freedom is a general optimistic vote for the future, that more good will come out of it than bad. I generally believe this way in many things that I do. 

But the general pushback to that is well, IF you can do something about helping the good and hurting the bad, aren't you morally obligated to do so? Maybe picking individual companies for moral purposes is just as fraught as picking them for financial purposes. At least with spreading the investments around you will for sure at the very least invest in the good companies?",ethical investing

The primary downside is an increase in expense ratios and no certainty in doing any better (and sometimes worse) than the market as a whole.

No socially conscious fund will likely match your morals completely, so if you are that convicted then a portfolio of individual stocks you have researched yourself would be in order.

He took me out of the Vanguard indexed bond fund I had and into odd-lot-size federal-tax-free (not state) municipal bonds, with staggered maturity dates, no more than 10 years, and then the company manages the bonds, buying others as they mature.

I am not surprised when you mention about your wife getting mildly annoyed with you ""conservatism"" :-). Your numbers don't even require you to withdraw anything from the capital/corpus. So yes, this is a backhanded compliment. 

You acknowledged the role of the college that gave you full scholarship. You can now think about naming a scholarship there after someone you love- and it can be just $500 per year, but would make a difference to someone. 

As for your self discovery-related questions, isn't it  a cultural meme to have a first stop in India? (OK, just kidding! - referring to the pilgrimages of the Beatles, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and countless others). I guess reading ""Siddhartha"" by Hermann Hesse would be a good start! 

The only other two thing that comes to mind are (1) surprise your wife/(and if) kids, make up for the time that you could not spend with them (2)  get out of comfort zone and do something you  never thought you could (like co-producing a TV pilot for Netflix in India with some of your FU money, if ever the Bollywood tickled your fancy when your were short on money and long on dreams!)

>The financial planner presented a case for having a mortgage in retirement, which I thought was interesting. He made a point to not to use it to overbuy, but rather—and this was particular to people with pensions—it can used to avoid some tax liability.

I'd love to see the ""mortgage in retirement"" argument played out a little better, because I have a feeling it's actually a fairly good idea. All that leverage means keeping more of your money to work in the market, and you're at a time in your life where you may be ""using"" your house to its fullest. No full time job means you'll be at home at lot more, or if you're traveling that you'll have the time/energy/flexibility to do some kind of home sharing arrangement (sublease, airbnb, etc). Retirement really seems the ideal time to take advantage of the leverage and flexibility a mortgage offers.

However, I think *this* particular argument (that you can write off interest) isn't very appealing given the current tax situation.

>For those who are FERS-RAE or FERS-FRAE (people who pay more for their pension plan), the poison pill retirement adjustments pushed by zombie-eyed granny starver Paul Ryan (credit to Esquire), we were shown math that indicates you still benefit, obviously, from a full government career (the health care coverage being a primary factor), but the inflection points are about 8 and 12 years for RAE and FRAE. If you quit before then, not a huge loss, if you quit after then, you’re likely cheating yourself financially. I can’t replicate the math here, but I don’t think he was lying. He did point out that if the healthcare situation in US changes for the better (Universal / Medicare for all), many federal employees might find themselves re-evaluating the benefits of their benefits.

I'd *really* like to see their math on this. The problem is that it really does matter when those 8/12 years take place. FERS-FRAE is straight up robbery if you start young and plan to FIRE. You pay 4.4% of your pay during all of your working years **and then watch inflation eat your retirement away for one or two decades before you can start drawing your annuity**. This happens with regular FERS too, but regular FERS is so cheap you at least come out ahead. With how heavy the buy-in is for FRAE you're just subsidizing other's retirement *and it's mandatory*. Maybe one day we'll get the option to opt out of FERS, maybe even with some of the substantial cost of FERS being diverted into more TSP contributions (much less likely).",ethical investing

Third, government workers are already widely unaffected by market forces. There's a reason government jobs are seen as historically stable.

You can't have it both ways, nobody is entitled to a job.

Basically, individuals who look and sound like me don’t always need to be invested or motivated to land jobs, earn high incomes, win scholarships, avoid being fired, etc. All statistical commentary on demographics aside, I, as an individual, definitely benefited from this privilege in many invisible and uncountable ways. (This is the seed of those maladaptive bad habits I was talking about.) As a startup founder and hopeful government contractor, it’s becoming not uncommon for me to run into opportunities stating up front that priority will be given to people with genders, races and qualities other than my own. My lizard brain wants to play the victim in these moments, but it’s always easy to get perspective. Given that I had no choice in the matter, I guess I’d rather have had the privilege. I often say that the point of privilege is to use it and to me that means creating value, eliminating the causes of privilege in the first place, and having compassion and empathy for everyone I meet. It’s a real shame that the privilege that put me in such a good position to do all that also allowed me to skip the skill-building work that I now NEED desperately to actually execute on any of it.

Second: Talk to your friends and family of what you are experiencing. They will be able to help you and watch out for you. You need them and they need you so take the help.

I'm talking out of personal experience here. My sister is the hardest working person I've ever met, she's working in the economy sector. A mixture of to much work, stressful living conditions and a bit of bad mental health from the start got her suicidal. She went through our town looking for places to hang herself.

She went to cognitive behavioral therapy, she got medicated and had a sick leave from the job some weeks. But she's fine now.

* Go to physical health doctor to rule out medical problems, always a good idea (now you also have a note for your SICK DAY!)

* Have some more compassion for people with burnout, including yourself: That's not just something ""unmotivated"" people ""use as an excuse.""  Jobs are hard, adulthood is hard.  I burn out sometimes because my job is high-stakes, low pay, and sometimes I can't save everyone and people die.  That's a legitimate reason to burn out.

Start by giving yourself 15 minute breaks in the morning and afternoon to take a walk outside (park or even around the parking lot). Take dial in meetings from a local coffee shop or park on sunny days. Pick up a hobby, something that relaxes but motivates you, to get your mind off work. It sounds like you are one step away from your hard work paying off, so start detaching yourself from what your work used to be. A lot of times we feel burnout because we take on too much and get trapped thinking we have to do it all.

bab2ah,ekbm29k,oinobreches,"Hey OP.  It's good you're reaching out, because burn-out is real and it hits you when you don't expect it.  We're all tired at different points in our life - any parent will tell you what that is like.  But what you have sounds very similar to my experiences in graduate school.

I have always been a highly motivated individual, and I work my ass off to achieve my goals.  I started a graduate career in Classics in NYC and just busted right in.  Rarely took days off, often stayed up 48 hours once or twice a week, and just kept pushing and pushing my reserves of energy to the limit.  My anxiety and stress were both very high, and my diet and hydration were pretty bad.

Welp - I hit a wall.  My final semester loaded me with four graduate courses and two classes I had to teach.  I was fine, I was fine, I was fine, I was fine.  I felt that high twitchy energy you get right before a large crash - you start swinging your arms more when you walk, no pace is fast enough, your eyes dart around more.  I finished my semester, felt really good for a few days, and then all of a sudden - wham.  I began sleeping 18-20 hours a day.  Not because I wanted to - because I HAD to.  It was compulsory.  I slept away the entire month of June.  I'm not kidding you - I didn't know what day or time it was half the time.  I lost 35 pounds because I wasn't eating.  It scared the shit out of me, and I had no idea what was happening to me.  I began to fear that I was dying or experiencing some sort of strange neurological condition.  Nope - I checked with the doctors.  Everything was fine.

&#x200B;

Then the brain fog hit.  This is where the real suffering starts.  I lost my ability to intake physical stimuli from my outside world.  I knew that I was touching, seeing, hearing, tasting things, but my brain wasn't picking up on any of it.  I could no longer feel a breeze, or a touch.  I could hear 50% of what was going on around me.  Time stopped - I could no longer feel the progression of time, and I never seemed fully aware of my day.  Human interaction was almost impossible, because my abilities to process complex sentences had vanished.  If you've ever had a deep conversation with someone while incredibly high, then you have a rough approximation of what I was experiencing.  Multiple times I lost my ability to speak because I had forgotten how to control my mouth.  There were multiple times where I experienced deep dissociation from my body.  I felt like I was hovering above it, ""driving"" it in different directions.  It felt like I was tugging a rowboat through water.

&#x200B;

Worse - I could no longer feel emotion.  I was dead inside.  I couldn't experience anger, sadness, joy, nothing.  Yet, deep inside I could feel this small kernel of what was ""me"" trapped inside.  My soul was a prisoner in my flesh, beating desperately against the walls to be let out, afraid it would be trapped in there forever.

&#x200B;

If there is a more extreme kind of psychological torture, I don't know.  I finally snapped out of it after **3 more months of this**.  To this day, I am afraid of returning to that place - that hell where nothing exists and where I am outside of my own person.  I did see a therapist, who believed that intense work-related anxiety, social deprivation, lack of sleep, and depression all lead me into that place.

&#x200B;

OP - Please see someone about this.  You do not want to go where I went.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  When you finally burn out, it will be so unexpected and the consequences so brutal, you will wish you had sought help sooner.

&#x200B;

Please Please Please Please see a therapist, and consider dialing back your level of engagement.  Early retirement is sweet, but not if you have lost complete control of your person.  This is why I quit graduate school - that small trapped kernel of my soul felt such deep regret that I had brought myself to that hell, and knew that NOTHING I accomplished was worth this.  Early retirement is not worth a cataclysmic crash.  ",ethical investing

bab2ah,ekck373,throwawaypouetpouet,"I know this feeling so much. I did a massive burn out because of work hours a couple years ago and I went to the same fears you're having now.

Let me tell you one truth about any burn out : there will never be a good moment to burn out. Never. There will always be something telling you no to slow down now. The next month goal hit, the next promotion in 2 months, paying off the mortgage in 5 months, the project you've been waiting for 2 years finally starting, anything that will make you say "" if I just hold it X days or  if I can make it Y months then...""

You do this and the very thing that will make you stop will be your body when it'll shut down. Because it will. And I can tell you that no project will come to hold your hand at the hospital, no great opportunity will carry you from bed to the kitchen, no money will come and visit you when you'll be so tired you won't be able to leave the house.

I know it's hard when you have your head wrapped around the crazy work hours. You always feel like you can make it. It's hard to take a step back and it will feel even harder the first few months when you'll stop working. But then it'll get better.

Here's what I would advise you to do based on my experience and given you have the fund to provide for yourself (I had not). Stop now. Take some rest and rebuild your strength with the help of a therapist. Let go of what you think you can achieve if you only make it to the next month, it's not worth it. Seriously, it is not. Then, when you'll be ready, in a month, 2 month, 10 months , 1 year or more, then go back to work , set your own boundaries and go kick some asses if you want.

It took me 8 months to recover, and even after a year back at work I still take care of not going back to this. And I feel way better than before. I got in debts during my medical leave, it sucks but it was worth it in the end if it means choosing between good health and no health at all.

bab2ah,ekatxdd,Zdth,"Okay everyone posting so far aren’t wrong for suggesting you take time off- but I bet the reason you haven’t been sick in 8 years or whatever is because you don’t feel like you can or there are consequences for doing so (social or career wise).  Intermittent breaks from work to reset are crucial to overall heath.

I would suggest you look into taking FMLA leave. It’s federal law that basically tells your employer that you have a serious health concern and that you’ll need a minimum of 3 weeks to address(up to 12 weeks). The law means that you can take time off work (unpaid typically unless you have sick leave or some short of Aflac insurance) and not have consequences- like being fired or officially reprimanded for taking that much leave. It also protects your health insurance while you deal with the medical issue- which could be yours first hand or that of a spouse/dependent. How most ppl take maternity/paternity leave or have surgery.

If you’re employer is private and has less than like 50 employees you don’t have the option to claim FMLA benefits but you might have some sick leave protections from your state.

Edit: I forgot to add application tips!

You don’t just tell your employer that you want to take FMLA leave. FIRST: go to your medical provider and figure out at least an initial diagnosis- this will help you understand if it’s covered as an acceptable “medical issue”. There are criteria, like the treatment must mean that you’ll be unable to return to work for at least 3 weeks or something to that effect- I can’t remember the exact phrasing.

You can also take FMLA leave on what’s called an intermittent schedule- so basically reducing your work hours each week so you can attend doctor appointments- which would include any medical appoints (specialists, general provider, counselor or therapists, etc)

Edit: wirds and....

Then after you have that information, you should probably ask whatever medical provider about their process for filling out FMLA paperwork- THEN you go to HR and say you have a medical condition that you’d like to take FMLA leave for- they SHOULD NOT ask you any questions that make your reveal the medical reason why- you should be given a form that is then filled out by your doctor with limited medical information that speaks more to why you need to be on leave and for how long (having surgery and post surgery therapies- 10 weeks, the 4 weeks part time)- this last part about the form feels a little like I  “pulled outta thin air” so pls tell me where I got it wrong",ethical investing

Most people who are fit for the type of positions that afford the ability to retire early (well educated, hard workers) are driven by the fact that they are making a difference in the world. The affect/power they have significantly diminishes after retirement. Yes life gets ""easier"", less stressful, more relaxing, and while it may sound very attractive to the average lazy redditor, ironically it is generally not as attractive to the type of person that has the traits to get to that place in life to have those options in the first place. 


Take the most common example in this sub, an engineer working at a large tech company. This person is most likely working on the latest and greatest tech, with state of the art equipment, and other extremely intelligent people. Their work will often have a relatively large impact on society as a whole, maybe they are the design lead on the EKG feature of the apple watch. Their work and decisions they make in that job will have an order of magnitude greater and more positive impact on society than anything they could achieve after retiring. Doctors, Surgeons, CEOs, Chemists, Biologists, Astronomers, nothing they ever do in retirement would have as great of an impact of the human race, as what they are doing in their careers. 


The type of person that has the qualities and drive to achieve that title, is someone who is very different from the average lazy redditor.

aegsi5,edpew44,saildawg,"As a physician (ophthalmologist) I can tell you that if FIRE is the goal, becoming a physician is a bad choice. First of all you have to spend 12 years minimum of education and training (4 college, 4 medical school, 1 yr intern , 3 years residency (some fields more) and possibly a few more years in fellowship/specialized training). Most people are in their early 30s when they are done and due to insane costs of education have a negative net worth of -250k+. Needless to say medical school is grueling and intern/residency is worse. You also get paid very poorly in intern/residency making it almost impossible to make headway on student loan payments and building wealth. I was working 80+ hours a week for 40k, and still had to find time to study and pass boards that cost thousands of dollars. So after going through all those grueling years when you finally get that big paycheck job most physicians feel entitled to escalate their lifestyle. Huge mortgage with no money down becomes a regular purchase and banks love to offer it without PMI so physicians jump at the opportunity to have what they can’t really afford. So most become way too comfortable with debt having 250k+ in student loans and 700k+ in mortgage. Additionally few realize how much of their paycheck they are going to loose to taxes, and just how terrible it is to have to pay debt/interest with after tax money. Once they do realize just how much it sucks to loose somewhere between 25-35% of their earnings they are ripe to be taken advantage of by insurance salesmen posing as advisors offering whole life insurance.  And so it goes for most, and guess what comes 10 yrs later?  Depression and burnout which is becoming the norm for most physicians. So that is why you don’t see most physicians becoming FI. 

Also after 12 years of training you develop skills (surgical and procedural) that were hard to develop and easy to loose without continuous use. It is hard to give up the skills if you retire early. 

All this doesn’t mean it can’t be done. I am 36 and am about 1/2 way to my lean FI number.  I have the advantage of less than average student loan debt and dual physician household. Check out physician on fire website for his story. 

Lastly most physicians probably like their jobs and just want to do it less than they have to right now.

We started having the dreaded “skip level meetings” where your bosses’ boss, or possibly your bosses’ bosses’ boss, will interview everyone with an eye towards the new structure that would allow the company to survive their incompetence and make a comeback. For us, this meant Americans visiting and holding back-to-back interviews in the big conference room. The fear was palpable. Morale was gone. People were openly working on resumes, discussing job opportunities and stealing supplies. They could not stand a gap in employment. Even a single missed paycheck would be a tragedy with serious implications. Even local leadership had given up and were looking elsewhere. Since I didn’t “need” the job I decided I wouldn’t really participate in the interviews in the way the expected. No hat-in-hand promises to work harder for less money for me. All I would talk about is what I would do if I ran their company in my country. I talked about the industry and our place in it.

aegsi5,edpkcd7,,"Because the point of life is not to retire and do nothing. The point in life is to work towards, and make progress towards goals. Retiring early (if actually done right and not like all these people who say they got depressed after a month in posts on here every day) can allow one to set new goals outside of career oriented paths, and work to achieve new things for themselves; whether to run a marathon, master an instrument, squat 400 pounds, whatever. 

But a lot of people are still chasing career goals. They’ve set a goal and they’re working towards it, and each day they work hard and see noticeable incremental progress towards that goal, it makes them feel fulfilled. So they’re not quitters. They’re going to achieve what they set out to, and what makes humans feel “fulfilled” is not the end result of reaching a goal, it’s the process of seeing hard work pay off towards a goal (I.e. all that practice and today you played the song perfectly, or hit a bench press PR). Seeing that your work is paying off and then continuing to work to get even further. That’s fulfillment. 

So when you see posts on here about someone who retired early and is depressed and doesn’t know what to do with themselves and decides they need to work again; it’s because they didn’t understand that. 

Humans need to be working on something, trying to achieve something, and seeing progress, in order to remain fulfilled. 

It’s chasing the PhD that is fulfilling, not just, having it. 

Despite your day dream fantasy, waking up with literally zero responsibilities is not going to feel fulfilling. It literally almost never is. And the fact you don’t understand why more people aren’t scrambling to live such a meaningless daily existence... sure there’s ways for early retirement to not be meaningless. There are other ways to seek fulfillment. But what’s wrong with doing it in your career? 

What are you going to do when you retire? If your “goal” is to be able to sit on you ass and do nothing , you’re in for a rude awakening. You’re not going to like it. 

Also, it’s a bit, I don’t know, pompous, to make a post saying “what is wrong with all these people who don’t want the same thing that we do?” “Why doesn’t everybody have the same life philosophy as us? It’s so dumb!” ",ethical investing

aegsi5,edprdgv,gnomeozurich,"A lot of the dentists and doctors I'm familiar with who own their own practice don't do a 40+ hour week, and only schedule non-emergency appointments 2-3 days a week.

I think that with a little work professional practices can be scaled back to something like 1/2 or 1/4 time without too much difficulty once you have a reputation and steady client base.   

I would also guess that most people don't go through the level of education (and debt) and apprenticeship required to become successful in those fields, I doubt anyone gets to that 300k+ earning level that doesn't either enjoy some aspects of the work, or get a lot of satisfaction from either serving their clients or the prestige of the position -- which means that a scaled back career with good work life balance may be preferable to a full-on retirement for many.

One key thing is that unless you're paying attention, you don't necessarily *notice* who is working part time because a doctor's schedule is always by appointment.

I see this in the financial services business as well.  Among people who have a solid book and say 150k+ recurring revenue from fee-based business or trail commissions -- it's pretty normal for them to work ""banker's hours"" (9-4ish) while also taking a ton of days off or long vacations.   Then there are others who push on keep developing new business beyond referrals and want to get into the million/year range or lead a big practice by recruiting and training lots of junior advisors, but that's a distinct minority of people who are successful.


So I think that part of the answer is that in a lot (not all) of these high paying professions, it's possible to carve out *much* better work-life balance than in many other careers, once you've achieved a certain level of success. 

Investment banking is probably the exception, which is probably why the financial rewards to staying are so crazy high, to basically suck you in to continuing to work 70-80 hours a week or more even after you are FI.

A. Filling the Void-  What to do with so much time even if you have hobbies and vacation.

B. Money /SECURITY- For most of us who worked from nothing to become successful, it's hard to give up so much annual income (especially when work is not that stressful).  EVERYTHING out there tells you that Money is the currency that can buy anything so the more of if you have, the more you can get (experiences, things or whatever). There is also irrational fears that  $5M is not enough or $10M or whatever number you want to put in is not enough. Lifestyle creep factors into this as well as when you're doing very well, you're generally going to have the bigger house and better cars, vacations, etc.

C. Sense of Self - Who are you without the job /profession/company. If you have a social structure, amazing money, and some prestige from the job.  If you retire - I lose all 3 plus the income. I think this is even more apparent with lawyers and doctors from just the people that I know.

No.  I just felt even more foolish for having looked at it and not seen what they were doing in the first place.)

I'm telling you this story because I wanted to warn that doing this due diligence can be very time consuming.  I feel hypocritical when I think about how my s&p fund likely includes companies such as this one, but one small consolation I take is that this investment is a small percentage, and that for the sake of diversification I can't picture myself ever realistically having the time to do accurate due diligence on so many companies: I failed even when I tried to for a single one!

If you can find some fund doing that DD for you, go for it: but understand that even then it may not fully align with your personal feelings.  This is where you will have to ask yourself how far you are willing to go for the sake of matching your values exactly.  For me, I no longer trust myself to be a good judge of that on an individual company level, and I have accepted that with an index fund I might be buying both ""baby and bath water,"" and I have chosen not to throw both out.  But whether you can choose that - and accept that, in a small way, you would be (as I am) a hypocrite for that choice - that is up to you.  For me, I am taking what I feel is a small level of hypocrisy for the sake of feasibility of investing.

To tell the truth, the entire notion of stocks is something I find fundamentally stomach-turning and misguided: encouraging companies to think short term for their next quarterly report instead of long term good.  But if this is the engine that our economy has chosen for wealth building, and my goal is ultimately to break free of the trappings that come with our consumerist economy by ""beating the game,"" the only doorway that I personally see to escape it without being homeless is by playing it well enough to cash out of the game.  I confess that it is cynical and hypocritical, but I am willing to compromise on my personal disgust with the idea of stock markets and quarterly reports for a chance to escape the world that has been built by both.  If I chose to not invest, I would still be stuck in and paying out to this same system indirectly through my continued participation as a consumer: and even after FIRE, I will still be a member of society and thus a participant in this economy: but I will have at least gained the leverage to do things like donate to good causes, choose where to devote my former employment time more willfully, and hopefully make some good happen even while being a member of an economy whose fundamental forces I disdain.  This way of investing presents the first door I have ever seen that might let me escape at least some aspects, and have a potential to make a greater impact on positive change in the long run - and I am taking it whether that makes me a hypocrite or not.

Basically, my hypocrisy is a choice I am making to try to survive this game that has been made out of our economy, as I see no other real alternative that wouldn't leave me in the same or worse position than I am in now: and if I am going to be in this economy either way, I would rather take on some hypocrisy for the chance to make at least some aspect of it better, if even only for myself, my family, and whatever causes I can help once I am FI.  But we must all decide as individuals how far we are willing to bend, and where we are willing to compromise for some other positive purpose: and I can't blame and won't judge you for wherever you personally draw that line.   I will confess, some days I am sickened with myself for where I draw that line.  I don't know if that feeling will ever go away, or if I will come to regret my hypocrisy.

I wish you luck in figuring out where the line is for you, and how to make it work.  It is certainly a hard choice.",ethical investing

Otherwise, if you want to do things ethically, you have to look at a managed fund's criteria. Do they look for businesses that do active good, avoid certain things like weapons and questionable business practices? I did not find any passive investment funds that are properly ethical in my eyes.

My way of doing it is I'm sticking with the index tracker funds + government/corporate bonds for the bulk of my money and throwing a smaller chunk at stuff I deem ethical and hoping some of it makes the world a better place. I'll almost certainly end up retiring a few years later because of this poor financial decision but it helps me sleep a bit better at night.

I'm also a middle TN resident. Love the cost of living here, the topography, beauty and generally the folks around. Good place to live. 

I dream of retiring early, but really think it could be a 'grass is greener' scenario. I'm guessing your late 30s since you just had a 20 year reunion. I'm wondering how much the boredom and looking for something new is hitting you right now? I feel like I'm going through a mid life thing, with some boredom and 'groundhog day'esk feelings happening. Grats on being retired, btw. 

Currently working (love my job) in a financially good job that I enjoy coming into every day. No retail public, just technical folks like myself. Have you ever felt like you've followed the instructions, climbed the mountain; enjoyed the view and are looking for something new? It's an odd feeling, like 'what now'? I've been contemplating if the climb/struggle/learning process is actually the real goal and not goodies at the end - seems cliche, but who knows. 

I wholeheartedly agree that Big Pharma companies are out of control and IMHO are legalized drug dealers. It's way to easy to diagnose and prescribe some pills when we need to be listening to our mind/body/spirit more. Eat well, exercise, rest well and laugh with friends. Opiods seem crazy out of hand atm. Watched a Netflix doc about a poor rural county in WV where the epidemic is rampant. Pity, sorrow, anger, for those affected as well as a good does of fear for the generation behind us. 

Dunno what I'm rambling on about. Grats on FIRE. Take care and enjoy.

Are you spending much time on fun things that had not occurred to you at the time you retired, or do you have any specific plans in that category?

One thing I'm curious about with regards to retiring early is whether I have some finite list of things that really interest me, or whether I will keep coming up with new ideas that I'm just as excited about as I start to cross items off my bucket list.  For example, I'd be interested in running a marathon after FIRE, but probably only once or twice.  Once that's off my list, its hard for me to know whether I'll be just as excited about the next idea (likely because I keep getting new exciting ideas for fun stuff to do), or whether some of the most exciting stuff will get checked off the list early, leaving me with progressively less exciting stuff down the road.

For much of my working career, the top items on my ""if I had more time I would ____"" list have been the same, simply because they are impossible to accomplish while I'm employed.  So while I'm very excited about this list, I worry that I'll be less excited about what the list looks like after I do a few of those favorite items.",ethical investing

For me, I've been finishing my MBA (which may be a mistake since it's so expensive, but oh well). After this semester I'll have 15 hours left, which would be another semester or two.

I've been learning Chinese, and since quitting my job I've made tremendous progress. I've probably made 3x as much progress in those 4-5 months as I had in the previous 4-5 years. I've been thinking about doing an immersion program in China early next year to get to a fluent level. 

I've also been focusing on fitness, and like Chinese I've made a lot of progress. I've been focusing on lifting weights for about 2.5 years now, and like Chinese I've made more progress in these last 4-5 months than I have in the previous 2 years. Before I was trying to stay at the same weight and slowly convert fat into muscle, but after quitting and working out more I started to get really hungry. I realized this was probably my body saying it wanted to build more muscle, so I've stopped my usual diet restrictions. I've gained 10 pounds while also lowering my body fat percentage. Last time I checked I was about 169 pounds and 12%-13% body fat. I'm 5'9.5"", and overweight BF% is roughly 20%, so even though I'm 3-5 pounds away from being overweight by BMI I'm 7%-8% away from overweight on BF%. Needless to say that's pretty good.

The one thing is that I quit with a very lean budget, so I'm looking for ways to supplement my retirement income. I have a couple different things I'm thinking about, but right now I want to focus on getting to a fluent level in Chinese.

I'm 22 that follows in your steps fairly similarly: paying for my own school, rent, expenses, everything. Very thankful that I'm currently interning in SF on a career pipeline path (except I don't like the occupation at all, but it pays well so I might stick with it to get rid of debt). Of said debt, I will only have $15k outstanding, which I plan on saving up after graduation to pay off ASAP.

I have a marketing background, although I study business entrepreneurship at a renowned uni, which has helped me get interesting job at startups during the school years. On the side, I do photography and plan on investing more time and money into getting that rolling to be another revenue stream. This'll be to build up more savings and spend on perhaps more leisure things every now and then.

I'd like to learn more hard skills, as well as find new side hustles to get more money, but it's been hard identifying what to do and being realistic about it. I love traveling and want to pursue a lifestyle like that when I'm in my 20's. Oftentimes it feels like an impending doom when school debts loom over me, Seattle rent being ridiculous, and life's occurrences happening and I'm broke at the end of the day, but I'm generally positive about the near future and what will come. Just every now and then I'm a bit demoralized.

Barring a stroke of exceptional good fortune, you likely had to work very hard at not only your job but your savings and investing goals.  I spent roughly 22yrs focused on making and saving as possible up until retiring this yr at 44.   I've found a ""phantom limb"" syndrome of sorts these days.  The muscle memory of work, earn, save, and repeat still twitches regularly and, although not an identity I particularly enjoyed, it has been odd to lose my societally-approved work identity.  I guess I've spent so long in rigid structure working toward my goal that things feel a bit adrift now that I've got it.

6pfpyo,dkpkb8g,dog-is-good-dog,"So, this is a super interesting post to me, because I used to have a very chaotic and ever-changing life as a musician.

I am also a crypto investor. Heed the words of others. It might be time to move the majority of your stash into a more stable investment. Keep some cryptos for fun, but know that you've done well enough to potentially sustain yourself for the rest of your life. That's an extraordinary fortune.

What's your next step? I would suggest setting a reasonable budget. Your expenses don't have to be as random as they seem. If you are comfortable spending 2.5k a month, set your limit at that. You like technology, I assume, as you are in cryptos. Use a mobile budgeting or tracking app like Mint or YNAB to track your expenses.

It sounds like you are basically FIRE now. You could live off the returns of 800k. But you seem unsure of how you want to live or what the future might hold for you. 

Perhaps when you visit Asia you can take a few days to sit down with your partner and talk about what you want, where you want to be, what your goals are? You have lots of resources to work with; it's now a matter of lining up those resources to work for you in a way that supports your life's goals.

Good luck!",ethical investing

You need to track expenses anyway for your art business. Just apply the same rigor to the rest of your spending.

The first thing I did was start saving my expenses. It's really  useful to be able to track my expenses and have a better idea on spendings. I started small with just accommodation and  food and then expanded further to include more categories. It only takes a min at the end of the day to add up what I spent every day.

Regarding your questions - I would calculate based on what minimums you average per year after taxes. I'm also familiar with fluctuating expenses but I found it helpful to manually track what my income is for that month – expense categories (i.e., groceries $500, travel $300, transportation $200, rent $1000). You can create a google sheet and keep adding tabs at the bottom for each month when it starts fresh.

I've got a plan laid out to get to $1MM invested over the years but because of the diverse income, a simpel savings rate didn't work out - just like your situation.

At $1MM you can draw ~$40k a year (substitute for euros if you want). So why not aim for that number first? Seconding /u/marum - diversify. You can DCA out of crypto into stocks/bonds. Maybe 25/50/25 as target if you're very fond of crypto?

By setting a hard number goal, you'll probably save more because you'll focus on meeting that number instead of being happy with whatever's left after spending. Increase the hard savings amount every year.

6wk24m,dm8o19z,brianmcn,"> I encourage you to clip or print out this column and bring it to your next meeting with your financial adviser.

I mean, it's nice advice, but 99/100 times you will get the wrong answer to question 1, as well as most of the rest.  Right?  Surely ""financial advisors"" outnumber fiduciaries at least 100-fold.  Has anyone reading this post ever interacted with an actual fiduciary?  If so please share your experience.

The way these questions are structured, after getting all the ""right"" answers, I don't see what value the person can offer other than helping you choose an appropriate asset allocation and then pointing you at the index funds to fill it.  You don't need to pay a CFP to do this, you could read a wiki and do it yourself.

I guess basically my thesis is that, given the assumptions of the questionnaire, it seems like a set up to say ""your current advisor has a conflict of interest and you should choose one without"" but that's the wrong conclusion, and the actual conclusion is ""you don't need an advisor, because investing is a solved problem and you can look up the answer on the web yourself"".

I don't personally totally agree with that conclusion, but c'mon, if

> Do you believe in technicalanalysis or market timing? (No)

6wk24m,dm8qa1g,big_deal,"> Do you believe you can beat the market? (No)

The question is overly simplistic - anyone actually seriously asking this question probably really _needs_ a financial advisor. But be aware the correct answer by an intelligent advisor isn't a simple ""No"". 

The correct response would be ""What do you mean by ""beat""? And which ""market"" are you referring to?"". And then they should proceed to explain the tradeoff between risk and return. And how it is quite possible to obtain higher risk adjusted returns than the US stock market by diversifying into uncorrelated asset classes and markets (although actual returns might be lower over the long term). It's also possible to achieve higher expected returns than the US stock market (higher beta or leveraged) but at the cost of increased risk and volatility, and most likely with lower risk adjusted returns. It's absolutely possible to obtain lower risk than the US stock market, but the tradeoff is lower expected returns.

6wk24m,dm8wkcu,gnomeozurich,"The questions are good, but some of the answers are simplistic.

Am I always a *legal* fiduciary?  No.   Do I always attempt to act in the best interest of my clients without regard to my own compensation?  Yes.  There are things you just can't do if you refuse to take commissions.  It's fine if you want to refer those out, but I believe it's perfectly reasonable to do them yourself as long as you have full disclosure.

In terms of mutual fund sales vs. fiduciary accounts.  In many cases you can get the client a better long run deal at the same advisor compensation level in mutual fund ""sales"" vs. an advisory (fiduciary) account.  

Negotiable fees are a double edged sword.  I can't negotiate insurance company or mutual fund fees and commissions.  While I *can*  legally/contractually negotiate advisory (fiduciary) fees, I have some serious ethical problems with this position.   

Advisory fees can be anywhere from me barely getting paid to the client getting massively ripped off, and the typical in the industry for accounts less than 2-3MM is around 1.8% total which is pretty high, and more than I'd charge to any of my clients, even small ones.   The way I see it, if I'm willing to negotiate fiduciary accounts with anyone on an ad-hoc basis (as opposed to having a sliding schedule based on assets), then I'm basically willing to work cheaper for some people than others, which, to me is effectively abdicating my fiduciary duty to everyone who doesn't try to negotiate my fees down.  I should be willing to charge *everyone* what I'm willing to work for, no more and no less.   That amount changes for higher asset amounts of course, as twice the assets isn't twice the work or difficulty of work, but IMO, it shouldn't ever change just to get a particular account who wants to pay less.   I explain that to anyone who wants to negotiate my fee structure on such accounts.  I point out that I've spent a fair bit of time creating my schedule in order to be fair to all my clients, and that part of what *I* understand about operating in my client's best interests is that if I'm willing to lower my fee for one person, I should be willing to lower it for all my clients.

meaningfully because they are living paycheck to paycheck. Not saying this is a good idea, but it's also not entirely a choice. Investing is easy when you have money. For those without, the idea can seem laughable at the amount they have to contribute. Education related to finance also plays a role. It's well established that long-term rewards aren't well understood by human brains.

And while there are certainly rich people today who invest carefully, there are also rich people today who blow their wad or burn through their inheritance. There were also rich aristocrats in medieval Europe who took great care managing their assets and investments, minding every pfennig.

It's just that the growth in the capitalist economy has allowed all peasants to join that class.

You want to instill a strong work ethic in your children ... by working a job 3-4 days a week on something that you enjoy...

Would this really instill a strong work ethic? You're taking a job that's fun, and working only hours that don't cramp your lifestyle too much.

How are we defining work ethic here? I imagine that part of it includes doing things that you don't particularly enjoy, or don't want to do, for some later pay off -- like studying hard in school, or taking an entry level job.

You have presumably grown up with discipline, hard work, and the ability to delay gratification, to achieve a measure of success -- so you don't have to any more. The grind, for you, is over.

How can you instill the idea of the importance of the grind in your children without setting that example for them? And presumably, you don't want to spend the next 10-15 years grinding just to set such an example.

This is why, I suspect, that the children of successful people are often less / not successful in their own lives. You cannot easily create the same milieu that helped you develop your success while you were growing up for your children. Work ethic, discipline, and ambition are difficult to instill in an environment where there is abundance. It's that old ""shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in 3 generations"" idea.

I suspect that any effort to recreate the ""same"" environment that you grew up in for your children will end in failure. The answer is really going to be to find a new path. How to do that, and what that path should be, is the question. Let me know if you find any answers :)",ethical investing

> We can backdoor Roth some of this money in lower earning years, thereby never paying taxes on some chunk of it.

You sound like you're getting confused on what exactly a backdoor Roth is. Backdoor Roth doesn't avoid taxes - it avoids income limits on Roth contributions. It is useful only in the accumulation phase (pre-retirement) and only if you have already maxed out all your pre-tax options.

> What the backdooring process will actually look like in our case, and how much in taxes it would actually save. 

Backdoor Roth only saves you from taxes on gains. In the ""lazy"" case where your backdoor Roth account is invested primarily in equity index funds, the tax rate is long-term cap gains, which is 0-15%. If you aggressively optimize asset location by placing tax-inefficient investments in your Roth, you could realize savings equivalent to your marginal income tax rate (probably 0-20ish%).",ethical investing
8wnxv4,e1x2rgu,ricksebak,"> We are likely not going to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than these years. Of course, I don't know that. I'm not even sure how I should be estimating that.

This would be based mostly around your spending, which you estimate at 40k per year. Then if you have any other 0% space left (or low percent space, depending how seriously you take tax minimization), you would use that for Roth conversion, cap gain harvesting, etc. But 40k spending is your main number to think about.

> Each year when we take a distribution from the non-Roth IRAs, the first $x amount of it (equivalent to the standard deduction, which for a married couple is currently at $24k) is effectively taxed at 0%. And $24k is a pretty good ways to the $40k or so we currently think we need to live on. Is this correct?

Yep. Pull out 24k from the tIRA and either convert it to Roth or just spend it, 0% tax. Pull the remaining 16k that you need for spending from your brokerage account, and pay LTCG of 0% on that too. (Then maybe do 60k of tax gain harvesting too, to max out your 0% LTCG space, though this might or might not throw a wrench in your ACA plans, see the link below.).

> We can backdoor Roth some of this money in lower earning years, thereby never paying taxes on some chunk of it.

You're not describing a backdoor contribution. If anything, you're describing a Roth conversion ladder. MadFientist has an article about this in the sidebar FAQ. But yes, you can/should do this.

> What the backdooring process will actually look like in our case

This isn't a backdoor, it's a Roth conversion ladder, but the process is this: Take 24k out of the tIRA and pay taxes on it at 0%. Pretty simple. Either use it for spending or convert it to Roth (which the IRS considers the same as spending, basically).

> and how much in taxes it would actually save

It saves however much you're contributing now per year, times your current tax rate.

>  in an ACA (""Obamacare"") situation, wouldn't it help greatly with reducing your health insurance costs?

Remember that the ACA has an income floor, not just an income ceiling. You need to have enough taxable income to make you too-rich for Medicaid, in order to qualify for the ACA. Conversions of tIRA -> Roth IRA might help you, but remember that LTCG also count against your income for the purposes of the ACA. This is a super complicated topic, so I'll just recommend you read https://www.gocurrycracker.com/obamacare-optimization-vs-tax-minimization/.

> Is there anything else (like a home buy at some point, or moving abroad) that would factor into the Roth vs. Non-Roth decision?

Buying a home (with a mortgage) raises your yearly spending by a lot, in which case you might need way more than 40k and then it bumps up your tax rate.

I think one of the main things is to make it a slow diffusion into the joint account rather than a ""big dump"".  

A few ways to do this - simple monthly ""add to"" for the combined savings, simple and easy.  It allows you to 'invest in the marriage' the same way you invest in the market.  Pass it off as wanting to do more as a couple and this will make it easier, but still require good financial habits.  Even if it is just $500/month, a small amount each month to where it will trickle in over time.  

""Matched Savings Goals"" - set up a savings goal, and make the 'reward' a match from your bank.  Say you save $5k more this year compared to last, you will match the extra $5k to really balloon the savings.  Make it something you both have to work towards together.

You mentioned real estate, if he is a DIY type, can you see if he can match your cash with sweat equity?  Basically, you both look for the purchase, you pay for it, and he fixes/upgrades/repairs it.  It allows you as a couple to use things from both people (your money, his time/skills).

Last method is a bit 'shady' but it will work.  Basically say you want to open up a 529 for the kids, but you want it to be ""from the parents"" not ""just from mom"".  So you will move money from your bank to the family bank, then invest in the 529 from there.  The shady part is after he is used to seeing the deposits, just start making a couple of extra ones.  Maybe move to 3/month rather than every 2 weeks.  Won't be huge amounts, but again, a small trickle that grows over time.

3ji6zb,cuqasp1,FiDiy,"  I was in your situation.  We both had come from disastrous previous marriages and were not comfortable with co-mingling accounts. We each had separate accounts as an everyday practice, but were joint.  This helped when she was short for example.  I could give the credit union a quick call and the money would get transfered.  In reality, neither of us protected ourselves if we had made a second disastrous choice as a partner.  We both were fortunate.

 My family wanted what was best for me, and giving away 'family' money would have had repercussions.  ""Giving up the family farm that's been in the family for generation!!! You're thinking with the wrong brain"". Her family felt the same way for her. Thus, family money was kept separate.  For us, originally, wealth brought into the marriage was separate, but what we  built together in the marriage was so much that we both feel that it all should be split, if we ever part. For example, I had a home that was completely paid off and didn't want to give it away to a potential golddigger was my first marriage baggage and fear. Last year, it was sold and the proceeds bought our current home, and it is jointly owned.  The laws in my state (and most states) support our outlook. If the family money is separately owned, it remains separate.  If or when it is changed to jointly owned, then it is joint and split.  Don't ignore this. Over many years, case law was developed to build some fairness in previous owning of chattel that once was marriage.  I imagine that this doesn't feel romantic, but marriage has a legal aspect that must be looked at from a legal perspective.  Take this with a grain of salt, too.  When a split happen, there is pain, some acrimony, and even people with stellar integrity can fall short.  We both worked and made about a 60/40 split.  She has been my love and my rock for years. Like your husband, my wife also the same admirable qualities.  She would expect to keep her side up in our marraige, and always has. A 50/50 split would be only closer to fair.",ethical investing

I do think that a longer standing relationship could eventually make this an easier discussion.  It wouldn't surprise me if he is thinking like I would if in a similar situation - what we each bring into the relationship is yours or mine and what we build while together is ours.

My wife and I are in our second marriages (first marriages were about 5 years) and even after 15 years together she still has a hard time seeing everything as ours vs. hers and mine. This is because I make 4-5x what she makes and I handle the investments which generate additional income, plus she brought 2 children and I only 1 into the relationship which meant her kids lived with us and mine never did.

I'd like to try and be helpful, so here's some things that you might be able to evaluate and see if they can work in your situation:

1: Is it possible for you to make due without a car? Cars are unbelievably expensive, and a lot of that cost isn't apparent right away unless you add all the little numbers up. Even if it's fully paid off, you're likely spending a lot every year on maintenance, gas, insurance, registration, etc.

If you can live within five miles of your job, it's easy to bicycle instead, which has added health benefits. Even if housing near work is more expensive than renting further away, you could run the numbers and see if you'd save more by not having a car, which could make moving closer to work very lucrative.

2: This can get a little touchy as subject for some people, but even if you love your job, I'd encourage you to always be looking for new opportunities. Connect with people on LinkedIn, send out resumes, look at company's websites for open job positions.
You are in your STRONGEST position for getting a new, higher paying job while you are already employed in a job you like. Prospective employers know they will need to woo you away from your current company in order to get you.

Check out [Early Retirement Extreme.](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/) You can live in a van and eat only rice and beans on $7k/year. Then after approximately 7 years ^1 you'll have enough money to continue living in a van and eating rice and beans indefinitely!

I don't mean to mock that choice (ok, yes I do, a little) it works fine for some people. If you want to retire early at what most people consider a comfortable standard of living, yes you're going to need to make more money. The #1 mistake people make in my opinion is thinking that their income is predetermined by some force outside their control. Look, there's money out there to be made in any field. If there weren't that field wouldn't exist as an economic activity. Look at people in your field who make a lot of money and figure out how to do what they do. I promise you they probably are not significantly smarter, luckier or better looking than you are. You can do what they do.

You don't need to be a math genius to understand the basic arithmetic in simple business accounting. It's great that you love editing and drawing, there's no reason you'd ever have to stop doing that. But don't preemptively limit yourself by deciding you *can't* do something. Approach it with a curious mindset and decide you'll try it and see how it works. I think you'll find it's easier than you think.

A number of my friends work in publishing and one of the nice things is that it's very easy to pick up freelance work, since most of the actual proofreading, copyediting, and typesetting is outsourced to freelancers. If you haven't yet, start honing those skills and making some connections with production editors at your company and other companies who will send you freelance projects. It can be a good side income for some relatively easy work you can do from home.

Food - groceries are cheap and plentiful.   Restaurants similarly so. Excellent street food.  Walmart type megastores are common.  Subway is cheap ($0.30 USD).  Tons of culture, museums, parks, etc.  

Transportation - It's the hub for the whole country.  Direct flights to most cities in Mexico and fares are pretty cheap (we paid $80 to Cancun IIRC).  Direct flights to elsewhere in Latin America. Direct flights from many US hub cities or 1 connection max if you want to visit/return to the US.  Intercity buses are awesome there and Mexico City is a hub for that too.  Tons of other cities/regions to explore within 2-6 hours of Mexico City so MEX is a good home base.  Weather is also perfect nearly year round in that region of Mexico (central highlands).

I feel like you probably would need to start by sitting down and carefully evaluating your spending and come up with a realistic estimate of exactly how much you spend per year now, exactly how much you need per year to support yourself in your current house and the new more expensive one, and a specific list of how much all the items in the extra spending above your 50K cost and which items you are comfortable doing without for the long term.

It sounds like even you don't have all the numbers you need to make this decision and also that its largely about how you and your wife value a lot of intangibles.",ethical investing
34bkpv,cqt5ojt,i_was_running_,"Let me break this down to the essentials:

* You make $50-55K/yr (post-tax?)
* Your basic living expenses are $50K, not including vacations, eating out, hobbies etc.
* You want to live off of your own salary *plus* buy a more expensive house if possible *plus* retire early

It seems pretty clear that something's gotta give, because all three of those things aren't congruous. Only you can answer what is the most important for you and your wife then work towards that goal.

Also, different people say different things, but I'm a firm believer in having at least 6 months of expenses tucked away for an emergency. I'd bump up your savings account a smidgen for safety.",ethical investing
34bkpv,cqt5jir,rootofgoodblog,"Hey, I'll give you my perspective from the other side of reaching FI and having 3 kids.  The youngest turned 3 today, and I've been retired since he was 16 months old, so I got to spend time with him almost all day almost every day since it really mattered.  

Mrs. RootofGood is still working, but takes tons of time off (negotiated an extra 5 wk paid sabbatical last year; going on a 3 month paid sabbatical this year starting in 5 days), so gets to see the kids a lot too.  She's going to quit when the negotiations for extra paid time off fail unless they offer something sweet to keep her on board (prorated pay and benefits for 10-20 hrs/wk or retain her as a contractor or something).  A big part of her motivation to leave work is to spend more time with the kids while they are young.  

That's the backstory.  

When we were both working full time, we were busy and didn't get to spend as much time with the now 8 and 10 year olds.  They stayed with grandma during the day while we were at work and it was a little hectic.  Staying with grandma wasn't nearly as beneficial for the older 2 kids as having the 3 year old stay with me all day (I guess they watched TV all day at grandma's house??).  

The huge upside is that now I'm retired, my wife is what you might call semi-retired given how little she actually works these days, and about to be retired soon.  We can afford to go on crazy trips (like our 7 week trip to Mexico this summer).  We are there every day to walk them to and from school, attend every single program/play/performance/awards thingy at school and after school.  Host playdates and sleepovers whenever.  And it'll be that way for the rest of their lives.  

So looking back, I'm very happy we both worked while the oldest kids were toddlers, since it let us reach our FI goals in our early to mid 30's and actually spend unlimited quality time with them for most of their childhoods.  It's hard to say if one of us becoming a stay at home parent at the expense of greatly prolonging our path to FIRE would have been a better life decision.  Maybe, but probably not.  YMMV of course.

TLDR: we're happy we both worked while the kids were very young because it brought about FI very early while the kids are still fairly young and permits awesome quality time with them and allows crazy long vacations.  ",ethical investing
34bkpv,cqt4t7z,jazzbrownie,"You could easily achieve FI with your current income, keeping the same lifestyle, in about 20 years assuming that you put back around 40% of your income.

If your wife quits her job, it's not happening for a long time.  I assume she would want to continue staying at home until your kids are both at least of school age, so you're looking at about eight years of her not generating income if we assume that you're going to have your second child in around three years, as you said.  

You'd have to make huge cuts to your expenses just to break even, so the nicer house in a nicer location (or even the same house in a nicer location) may not work with your income alone.  Early retirement wouldn't even be an option unless you managed to cut your expenses to less than 30k or so.",ethical investing

I would also look into changing jobs and increasing your income.  I figure your wife will be out of the workforce for approximately 8-10yrs, no reason she can not go back to work once both kids reach 6yrs of age.
  
",ethical investing
34bkpv,cqulo8q,MoneyMitten,"I did this. It was a very difficult, long and expensive process for us to have kids. After years of trying, we adopted a son and I gave birth to a son in the same year (actually 7 weeks apart AAIIIEEE!).

After all we went through to become parents I said to hell with work. I worked damn hard to create this family and I'm not going to send them off to have someone else take care of them. Not to mention we adopted a toddler, and it essential that he not spend time around a lot of caregivers so he could bond to us as parents.

You know, it's not unusual for little kids to sleep about 12 hours per night. My 3 kids (all different biological parents) all slept 7pm - 7am from about 6 months old to about 2.5 years old. When the heck are you supposed to spend time with your kids if you're rushing around, getting home at 5:30 or 6? Oh, you think you can just keep them up later? Doesn't work that way. Two of my three can't sleep in even if they stay up late.

Back to my point. When I decided to stay home, it obviously wasn't just screw this. We were in a decent financial position. We were debt free except the mortgage. My husband's salary covered our living expenses and then some. I also decided to work very hard to lower our budget by doing things like learning to cook delicious, inexpensive meals. I took the kids for lots of walks and we went to a lot of free playgrounds. It was a lot of work, but I'm so glad we did it.

I stayed home for 5.5 years. We adopted again and our youngest was 3 when I decided to feel out the job market. I received offers for 2 of the first 3 jobs I applied for. I put that I was a freelancer for this gap on my resume (I did do a tiny bit of freelance work, but no one really asks how many jobs you do while freelancing).

My kids are now 8, 7 and 5. I've been back to work about 1.5 yrs. I plan to work for a few more years (2-5?), then ""retire"". I say retire because I will obviously be a stay-at-home parent, but I don't plan to go back to work.

5oegfd,dciqsay,Shawnthgreta,"1. Generally decent options here include Ally/Discover for saving an Emergency Fund in a high-yield savings account (around 1%). Capital One 360/Ally/Credit Union for checking. For credit cards, I would suggest a cashback card (if you don't want to travel). Good options include: USAA 2.5% cashback, Fidelity 2% cashback, Citi Double Cash 2% cashback, Chase Freedom (5% rotating), Discover 5% rotating. For travel, see Churning.

2. They should provide you a list, you want to invest in low cost index funds (low expense ratios). Vanguard is often times a good choice. I would use your traditional age in your target date fund. You will likely need taxable accounts and Roth amounts to get to FI. Traditional accounts can help you in traditional retirement.

3. Long-term CDs are going to lose to a well diversified stock and bond portfolio. Don't try to time the market. I don't know what worries you about the market see the simulations someone ran over in personal finance, over long time periods the market isn't very risky. Real estate is an active investment, so I would agree.

4. Follow the advice over in the sidebar of personal finance, however in general: Save 3 month emergency fund, get employer matching funds in 401k, pay off high interest debt, max out IRA (traditional or Roth depending on goals), max out 401k, save in high-yield savings account for short-term (<5 year goals), invest in a portfolio of well-diversifed index funds for long term goals.

5. This advice may be overly vague, but it is true. Just don't spend money that does not increase your happiness. When you see the money coming in you may be tempted to spend, just don't. I would set a strict budget and use Mint and spreadsheets to track yourself against it atleast monthly (some of us do this daily). 

6. You don't need these to have good credit. Reporting revolving credit is your best bet. Open a few quality credit cards and pay them off in full every month. Look at Credit Karma for tracking this. However, be careful as inquiries temporarily harm your credit. 

7. In my opinion, you need to set target budgets before you start your life. In my case I did not, it is hard to figure out what you want to spend on rent if it doesn't fit into a larger picture.

If your investments are coming out of a traditional account or a taxable account, it will affect your MAGI, even though if it is subject to capital gains or whatever taxation, rather than income.

2tsv10,co228qo,mmoyborgen,"You will not qualify for EITC if your investment income is more than $3,350.  If you can do what you're talking about with investment income below that then I guess it's OK.

Personally I have used many of the programs available to low-income workers when I was low-income - I've been on food stamps, used first time homebuyer programs, etc.

However, if you don't need those programs then you really shouldn't take advantage of the system.

There was a time when there were asset limits in place to discourage fraud, but many states found it was a barrier for low-income families to encourage savings because once they did they lost access to their benefits.

Regarding ACA, if your income is really beneath the thresh hold then if you feel you need the assistance I guess go ahead and take advantage of the program if you qualify.  Who knows how long ACA will stick around for and how it will change over time.",ethical investing
2tsv10,co30fom,,"I don't think anyone's written a comprehensive guide because the whole concept has ethical concerns.  To the layman with no understanding of FI, the whole concept of FI probably sounds like cheating the system and adding in working entitlements to the max wouldn't help that impression.

Still, it's a concept that intrigues me so here goes my shot at it.  Ideally you'd own your house outright and have rolled almost everything into a Roth IRA in the past.  The ideal would actually to have a job so you can qualify for EITC and the Saver's Credit.  It doesn't seem like Roth contributions count as ""investment income"" that needs to be under $3,300 for the EITC.  You'd earn $5-11.8k at a job and put at least $2k into a Roth IRA and then you'd get $500 for the EITC and $1000 for the Saver's Credit.  If you earned more than what would qualify you for Medicaid, you could get ObamaCare at 3-4% of your income level, so under $500 for the year.  Might as well go full leech and pick up SNAP as well, for this you'll need to keep your liquid resources under $2k and live in a state that doesn't count your car as an asset.  Of course, I'm fairly sure that Roth income still counts against you for SNAP.  That should be roughly $2400 per year.

I guess the net benefit is around $1500 per year easily plus $2400 for SNAP plus whatever you save on health care premiums.

From a practical standpoint though, you'd be missing out on earnings that could have been coverted to Roth at a lower tax rate.   With a standard deduction and personal exemption, you'd fit $19k worth of earnings into that bracket.  Assuming you made $12k at your job, then you'd be losing out on a 5% discount on the additional $7k which boils down to $350.  You also couldn't take long term capital gains at a 0% rate which could pose challenges for tax planning.

I also doubt that $2400 in benefits from SNAP would be worth the quality of life that you'd suffer to be eligible for it by taking Roth distributions off the table.  Plus you'd have to apply for it and I'm not really sure that what you were doing wouldn't be considered fraud.

You can talk to your pension provider about moving into a pension that invests in this way.  You fill in a form listing your priorities in terms of ethics, and then that authorises the fund manager to invest only in companies that adhere to those ethics, and to work with executive boards to keep the company on track.  You can place different levels of priority, from ‘this is not important’, to ‘this is important but it’s good enough if they’re trying to move in the right direction, I’m not expecting miracles’ to ‘this is super important, they have to already be doing this completely, nothing less will do’.

Just be aware that if you are too fussy, demanding perfection across all categories, you will be severely limiting your investment options.

Looking for things I can control using the industries domain knowledge against them is a great solution to this problem.

About ethical investing, I have a little experience being a consumer of these. Here is what I've done and the result: 

Moved Index Funds - I switched some of my invested retirement money from an index fund tracking the S&P 500 (which includes oil and gas companies) to a fund branded as 'socially responsible' that refuses to invest in numerous things which happen to include fossil fuels. Result: Somewhat satisfied. I made slightly less money but my investments did slightly less harm. I generally expect that I will not make MORE money saving the planet.

h9xaps,fv0rvkf,qeryi,"1. The motto that I've heard from those that work in the recycling business is: ""When in doubt, throw it out"". There is already a problem of ""wish-cycling"", where recycling plants are overwhelmed with non recyclable material that people 'wish' or think are recyclable. And regarding contributing to the death of the planet - with something as large as sustainability, it's best to not get caught up on every little detail as a consumer, or you'll go crazy (speaking from experience lol).
2. I think part of why cafes do this is that it makes the customers feel better. Especially for locations that attract younger patrons, customer guilt about eating out and generating waste is a very real deterrent to business. Another reason may be that management just doesn't know that the compostable things aren't actually compostable when in the landfill - they just assume it will break down wherever it is. You can consider talking to the restaurant about this - even if they decline to offer composting services, at least there will be the few people that actually dispose of it correctly ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
3. Buying second hand is almost always better, unless you need to drive an hour to the shop or ship from Australia all the time or something. The reason is that the hidden resource cost of a new sweater, even one sustainably produced, is massive compared to traveling to and from a thrift shop, even 5 times. Patagonia's ""Don't buy this jacket"" campaign shows that even eco friendly brands recognize this fact. However, supporting eco-friendly brands is also important, so if you can't find something secondhand, don't be afraid to use a conscious company! You can also ride the line by buying high quality secondhand items. 
4. I dunno lol. Personally, I avoid falling for the beach plastic bracelet thing, since you're right - it's such a miniscule amount in the end. Using deadstock/salvaged material is better than nothing though, I just don't know how it compares to recycled material. 
5. You're right in that real change would need to be top down to make a tangible difference beyond just spreading awareness. Comapnies (namely the American can Co.) first pushed to shift the environmental blame on the consumer with the Crying Indian campaign in the 70s, where consumers were encouraged to recycle their trash. This shifted the focus from the company who was **the one making the trash in the first place**, and making sustainability a personal issue. As a result, a lot of sustainability efforts today center on packaging, when in reality it's the smallest part of an item's impact. (This is why I'm annoyed at the egregious packaging subreddit, since the people on there order like 5 boxes from Aliexpress and then complain about all the boxes it came in, touting sustainability). All this to say, I agree with recycling reforms, but first and foremost, **a carbon tax** (it worked in the UK!), and changes to laws and guidelines that dictate how a company can operate. Recycling will come naturally afterward, but as long as the bulk of responsibility is on consumers to recycle, nothing big will happen.",ethical investing

A bank that lends money to big oil or mining companies would probably not make it on the list of your investments either?

There are various funds that target people like you, but the fund's ethics may be very different from yours, as you've found. If you feel very strongly about this, typical stock market investment may not be for you. It would probably be easier (although riskier) to invest in something you have more direct participation in. For example, you could invest in a local business you support and, with the right custodian, contribute those shares to your IRA.

6nklsy,dka8bl0,coolcatjames,"I'll start with my credentials: I did SRI/ESG fund research for my company (smaller wealth management firm).

I believe what you're looking for are SRI (socially responsibly investing) and/or ESG (environmental, social, governance) funds. Within this universe, you can find a lot of actively managed mutual funds and passive index ETFs. Regardless of what option you go with, I would pay attention to the expense ratios and a possible front-end or back-end load (the first time I saw a fund charge a front-end load was when I read the description for a Calvert fund). Besides that, a quick Google search for ""SRI Funds"" should give you a good starting point. 

A common tactic that my company uses is to replace a portion of the Domestic Equity exposure with an SRI-Domestic Equity fund (ex DSI/KSI). That way overall asset allocation is still to par. If your advisor charges based off AUM, then this wouldn't affect their cashflow at all (hence why my company does it). 

One issue that I've found with the SRI/ESG fund universe is that each fund's criteria is different (ie. one fair-labor fund might filter out AAPL due to Foxconn controversy, but another fair-labor fund might include AAPL because of a positive work environment or something). To this, I would strongly recommend you do some research into each fund and read their Prospectus' and/or Morningstar top-10 holdings.

Ethical : adjective. pertaining to or dealing with morals or the principles of morality; pertaining to right and wrong in conduct. being in accordance with the rules or standards for right conduct or practice, especially the standards of a profession:

Taxes don't have a moral (religious) element; it's more around the ""social"" ethic. In that sense; being in compliance is ethical. 

There's a constant interplay of individuals and entities choosing to arrange their affairs to minimize taxes; and of governments choosing to change the tax rules to eliminate any of the loopholes that reduce taxes significantly, or in ways that was not the intent of the law.

Your question deals with more around individual views of what's socially acceptable vs the collective view. I might disagree with the law; but since there is a process by which those laws are made, that becomes a purely personal opinion and not something that's enforceable.

*  I would views this as a very small inheritance that will not change your lifestyle in any significant way.  To put it into perspective.  This is only 6 months of an average family income in the US.  It's nothing more than an emergency fund.

*  Unless you know a lot about stock trading or have some inside info that the other 1,000's of stock traders/analysts don't know, I would stay away from stocks.

*  Your young, so it means that in the next few years you may need this for a down-payment on a house, wedding, etc... Hence, I would be hesitant to put into an investment that ties down the money long term.

*  Be careful with making the ""Christmas shopping list.""  Do you really need a new laptop, camping gear... etc?  It is worrisome to think that you are already planning to spend a large portion of this money.  You mention that you come from a ""very low socioeconomic class.""  This is the biggest risk factor for you to end up poor.  Don't make the same mistake your parents did by blowing away all your money on crap you don't really need.

*  I would keep this money in a very secure investment (ie not individual stocks) that is liquid.  There is a good chance that you may need access to these funds in the immediate future.

* I don't know what your major is, and what your expecting to make after graduation.  However, I would try to save most of this $25k.

I'm currently investing about 40k in VTI and 12k in VB. These are exchange traded funds that seek to own small amounts of every stock. VB has high variance but very high 20-year returns and VTI seeks to match the stock market return on average.

We then set some reasonable limits for each category in order to have a number to keep within each month. It's pretty eye-opening to see it this way.

I think it would help to limit the number of grocery visits in a week or month. Keep grocery trips to once a week for starters. Try to eliminate convenience store trips, the costs for those are ridiculous, buy in bulk elsewhere. Most veggies/fruits keep for a week to a couple weeks, so it sounds like your purchase quantities for staples are too low as well. Buy dry goods in bulk. Keep an eye on what is running out and add it to next week's list and use up other foods that have been sitting around.

We keep most things in the fridge so they last longer and do curbside pickup every 2-3 weeks. It has helped us a lot to keep an eye on spending by ordering online...you can see how the cart is adding up and if excessive, eliminate extraneous items--especially if a want and not a need.

If sugary snacks/cookies are a weakness, why not make your own or buy a decent-sized package and limit yourself to one-two cookies per snacktime or day? If you're trying to support local, buy a dozen and freeze them.

If going to the grocery store makes you happy, I do know people who go almost everyday. But they do not overspend because they have broken their monthly budget into a day/meal budget. For example, maybe you go to the grocery store at the beginning of the month with a $100-$150 (whatever is comfortable) budget. Buy the things you eat for breakfast and pack for lunch.

gambling, and nuclear power. The index methodology also excludes the stocks of companies that do not meet the labor, human rights, environmental, and anticorruption standards as defined by the United Nations Global Compact Principles, as well as companies that do not meet certain diversity criteria.

Defining risk and opportunity cost is important here. 

 You don’t want to invest in broad based funds due to the conflict of morality. Yet, by researching and investing in a few socially responsible companies is in my opinion the true definition of not only subjecting yourself to extreme risk but the opposite of what you are trying to accomplish. You also need to have the expectation that by limiting yourself to Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) you are ultimately not going to assume returns in the ways most investors do long term ( both upside and down ) because there is a portion of the market that you are specifically excluding and not participating in the returns nor diversification of. 

You need to be okay with that “opportunity cost”. I would also caution yourself to never compare your returns to others for this reason. It will differ and is not an apples to apples comparison. I would either determine what level of morality is important but also use broad based Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) manager/fund to help with the broad based investment allocation (risk) and diversification (protection). 

I would also expect that your costs as an investor will go up because of the specific criteria relating to SRI. Anytime you drill down it makes things considerable higher and advisors/money managers will charge a premium for the additional labor involved. 

TL:DR: Use a SRI manager or Advisor who can facilitate such desire and help with management so you don’t lose your ass trying to accomplish what you feel is right.",ethical investing

I work in IT and previously worked at a financial advising firm. The main issue is not acting in your client's best interest, it's how you prove that you did so. It's an absolute nightmare. You need a ton of documentation.

""But just make the advisors document it"", have you ever worked with advisors? Honestly the majority I've ever worked with are just sales people that don't know much of anything and are incredibly frustrating to work with. You'd have better luck hitching up some cats to pull your sleigh to the north pole.

Just wanted to give you another perspective. It's not that these companies necessarily are against acting in their clients' best interest, but rather the massive pain it is to prove you did so so you don't get sued.

Final note: I'd personally not follow the advice 90%+ of advisors. It's not that they're bad people, it's that they don't know anything about finance and are just selling products they're told to sell with pitches they've been taught to pitch.

So, they dislike it not because they want to rob people but because it creates a ton of extra work for them. 

And maybe they are lying, or maybe corporate has different reasons for going against it. But individually I haven’t seen advisors against it for malicious reasons. ",ethical investing
9uendp,e93q9h8,Practical_Help,"I run a fee-only RIA.   


The CFP currently only requires advisors to act as fiduciaries when engaging in ""financial planning.""  The new standard will require anyone offering ""financial advice"" to be a fiduciary. This is a shrewd move by the CFP board to counter growing skepticism of commission ""advisors.""   


How?  


1. **Commmissions aren't banned.** From Investment News: 

""Every method of compensation has some kind of conflict of interest that has to be managed and dealt with,"" Mr. Salmen (CFP board) said. ""It's possible to earn a commission and be a fiduciary at the same time.""  


**2. Brokerage agreements state brokers are not giving advice**  


CFP knows that advisors can sell as many terrible annuities as they want because their brokerage account agreements claim they are not acting as advisors.  


For instance, the Edward Jones brokerage account agreement says:  


""Unless I have executed an Edward Jones investment advisory agreement in connection with this account, the account I am opening with Edward Jones is for broker-dealer services in a nondiscretionary account.""   


And later on in the same agreement,  


"" My Edward Jones financial advisor may utilize a professional designation. I understand that Edward Jones is not affiliated with any of the sponsoring firms of such professional designations and that **the use or attainment by my financial advisor of a particular professional designation in no way implies that either Edward Jones or my financial advisor provides financial planning services or investment advisory services for my account.** ""  


So, there you go. The brokerage firms maybe tweak their account agreements from ""investment advisory services"" (a legally meaningful term) to ""financial advice.""   
Now, the public thinks all CFPS are always acting as fiduciaries. And the dipshits at Edward Jones keep going on as usual.   


This muddies the waters and CFP knows it. They are a for-profit company and IMO, Ithey don't give a shit about fiduciaries. They could insist all CFPs sign a document that states they will act as fiduciaires ""in all dealings."" But, by restricting it to ""financial advice"", they leave a giant loophole for those who fall under the umbrella of providing custody, execution and brokerage services.  


That's why you'll never see CFP behind my name.

9uendp,e94rfyw,calevonlear,"I am a flat-fee CFP® (hourly/fixed retainer) and I must say, while this seems like positive news, it won’t necessarily fix problems within the industry.

The CFP® board is a private institution that regulates its members with standards of practice and a fiduciary oath. It is not regulated by any regulatory body and until such a sweeping declaration is made by actual regulatory authorities, there will always be loopholes to this oath. 

For those of you in this thread that are wondering what this means for you, the run-down is this:

If you are able, take responsibility for your finances and learn to be a good steward. If you cannot be bothered or prefer to delegate for whatever reason, find a fee-only advisor with no ties to any product or service. Hourly or flat rate is ideal as realistically the majority of the population takes a few hours of work every year or two or as life changes come about. Having a fee-only advisor on retainer can help you make smarter decisions with your money, but as your assets grow the largest determining factor of your overall success is how well you organized your financial resources, your overall risk tolerance, and the aggregate of fees you pay.

If you have questions about general personal finance or becoming a CFP® professional, I can answer them.",ethical investing
9uendp,e954d7d,auburnfan5455,"I am a CFP and I fully support the fiduciary rule. The issue these other companies have is that they consider financial planning as a separate service from investment management and insurance. The fact is that these services should be considered tools of financial planning, not separate. 

Their contention is that they can wear their CFP fiduciary hat when strictly talking about retirement planning, then put on their insurance sales hat for when they talk about insurance. The standard for insurance sales is something called the suitability standard which is FAR less stringent than the fiduciary standard in terms of how beneficial it must be for the client. In fact, fiduciary means best interest of client, and suitability only means it isn’t a totally irresponsible and inappropriate investment. That means if you understand the client needs insurance, then it doesn’t matter whether you sell the product that costs the client 10% of their contract value (in commissions of course) or the 2% cost. Both would be considered suitable but the fiduciary must recommend the best one for the client. 

Same for investments. Some have commissions and aren’t totally appropriate but because of the kickback for the advisor they may recommend the more expensive product.

That’s why it’s so important for investors when finding a financial advisor to find one who provides comprehensive, FEE-ONLY advice. Fee-Only means the advisor cannot earn commissions from insurance or investment products for selling them. They instead charge a fee directly to the client and recommend best interest investments. Follow the money, who does your advisor work for. You? Or the mutual fund company? Who is paying them?

Also a caution against advisors who claim to be few-based instead of fee only. Fee-based means they charge the client but also earn commissions. It’s double dipping.

9uendp,e94lynj,proflem,"Coming from a position of teaching & training future CFP's - A fiduciary standard is a great step forward. It gives more teeth to this professional credential. A fiduciary standard means advice provided by a CFP professional must be prudent, obedient, loyal and that professional must report co-fiduciary breaches. Prudence requires technical accuracy, obedient to instructions and goals, and loyal to the client. Loyal means looking out for the clients goals. 

A fiduciary duty is generally ongoing. Initial recommendations may be prudent when made, but as the client ages or has a life event happen - those recommendations may no longer be prudent. This is important in how financial planners treat people. 

Currently if I sell you an insurance policy - I have to make sure it's suitable at the moment - but don't have to make sure that recommendation stays up to date with you. 

So for CFP Board- a body of 84,000 financial planning professionals - to mandate a fiduciary duty with fewer exceptions than the current one - it's a pretty big industry bump. Those companies who don't like it have two options. Forbid their employees and advisors to use it, or adopt a fiduciary culture. ",ethical investing

I am not 100% up to speed on the debate but I think having advisors required to act as a fiduciary in all circumstances   sounds great, but wouldn't this make transactions that should be done with a brokerage fee (like a bond or stock one off trade) very difficult, even if directed by the client?  I would think there would be some unintended consequences?

Finally, why are all brokerage firms seen as bad?  I know there are some bad actors out there but if people are wiling to pay a fee for advice or for someone to take care of there finances, is that a bad thing?

It's not as simple as ""devious investment firms now have to act in their client's interests where before they were shamelessly stealing money hand over fist.""

 The rule wasn't very well written, so a lot of companies had to guess what parts of it meant and had to stop answering some simple questions for customers so that we couldn't be seen as acting as a fiduciary (which was impossible for us, and not our function as a company). 

One example is we used to invest funds in cash if we received money without any investment selection or anything on file to indicate what they wanted. We would then call them to see if we could determine what they wanted, and finally send a letter if not resolved (the vast majority would be fixed). With the DOL rules, we simply returned their money, no call or anything. So the first indication people had was they got their check back in the mail.

9uendp,e94w0g1,Brad654,"I have been a compliance officer for a lot of years with big and small firms. I have worked for Broker-dealers and Registered Investment Advisers, big firms and small firms. I can tell you that someone being a fiduciary does not make them honest. It is simply a set of rules that requires them to act in a specific way. The SEC is responsible for regulating 25k+ investment adviser firms with very limited resources, to some extend the states help but it varies. The reality of this is approx 18k of these firms have never been examined, i worked for an RIA that had been in business for 10 years and never once been visited by FINRA. This means that regardless that they claim to be a fiduciary, who is going to know if they are unethical until they have already stolen your money? In my experience an ethical person does not have to be a fiduciary to be ethical, they are or they aren't. I have seen just as many ""fiduciaries"" screw over clients as brokers. The line between Fiduciary standard and suitability standard is very small as the regulators have never truly defined what best interest is. Best interest is incredibly hard to define and i have seen many arbitration or regulatory exams find in favor of the adviser because best interest is very subjective. Personally i would welcome a universal fiduciary standard, it would literally change nothing for me as ethical firms already act in this manner. Sure not every firm is ethical but even if they were required to be a fiduciary, they still wouldn't be ethical and most likely all it would result in is a bunch of additional disclosures that clients will be asked to sign.

The argument that a 1% annual fee on my assets is cheaper is a very short term approach. Consider a standard Class A share mutual fund, typical load is 5.5% at maximum, in addition there might be a .25% 12b-1 fees. Over ten years your total cost would be approx 8% while a fee-only adviser at 1% would be 10% assuming no change in account value. In alot of cases you have enough assets to get break point discounts which makes these even cheaper. Maybe a fee-only adviser is a better approach for you, but don't just discount someone that does commission business just because of the term ""fiduciary."" Brokers are very heavily regulated and policed by FINRA. I hate FINRA btw, but my point stands.

Here is what i think are the best advisers in the industry. Dual registrants who are both Brokers and Investment Advisers as they can offer the broadest range of products that will fit your particular needs and situations. I actually think the CFP is a excellent credential, not because of the fiduciary requirement but because of the extra education. Choose someone not because of a word but because they are transparent, spend the extra time to educate you on your options, and are a good ethical person. The good ones dont need to sell you on a product, the lay out the options, explain the benefits/risks, explain how they meet your goals, and let you choose.

If you lived in the same state, you would earn about 10k a year working 30 hours a week, 50 weeks a year (2 taken out for sick days or vacation), at the minimum wage of 7.25. You would not be able to live alone. You wouldn't even be able to live with just one other roommate.


Edit2: to get a good idea of how rough it’ll be, talk to your parents and take over your bills. Pay for your own phone, your car insurance, your food, your portion of Internet and utilities, and figure out what rent for a 1 bedroom + renters insurance would be in that area and give it to your parents. You can ask them to put it in a savings account to give back to you since you’re under 18, but it’ll show you just how fast money goes.",ethical investing

However, in ten years you're going to look back on this comment and cringe SO hard.

Your parents still cover a lot of your expenses. You probably have *no fucking clue* how much health insurance and healthcare in general costs. You probably also don't realize how much maintaining a car costs- new tires, new brakes, fluid flushes, electrical problems, a new transmission... The car your parents helped you purchase will wear out eventually. You'll have to replace it while still paying rent/mortgage somewhere. You don't have the bigger picture. 

If you have an accident while rollerblading, that could be thousands of dollars of medical bills *with* insurance. Been there, done that with a cycling accident. Not fun.

I've worked all sorts of shitty low-level jobs through my school years. What does a future in fast food hold, if you don't own the franchise?

* Wage theft as they force you to work off the clock. (Or if you're a manager, forcing you to force your workers)
* Someone trying to rob the store
* Irate/crazy customers attempting to assault you (though this is a problem in healthcare, too...)
* Being relegated to 8 hours a week because the manager doesn't like you (NOT because you're a bad worker)
* Your great work ethic translating to diddly-squat extra compared to your stoner co-workers
* Finding people shooting up in the restrooms
* Getting sick of the same monotonous grind....

Also, you may just be a late bloomer physically, and may *want* to have a relationship sometime later. Don't rule it out. You have until approximately age 21 where working fast food won't be a detriment in the dating market, absent some upwardly mobile longer term plan.

**Here's a thought: Finish that degree**. Get a corporate job in your fast food company of choice. That *can* pay pretty well. **Save your money, get a business loan and buy your own franchise location.** The bank, upon seeing a long/thorough grounding in the industry and the salary history of your corporate job, will look favorably upon your request. Boom. You own your own restaurant (or three) and can work the floor while making a hell of a lot more than you would as a shift manager.

Finally, have your parents teach you more about how much money (and time, and energy) it takes to actually run a household, even at a basic level. Use that info to inform your career choices.

I have a major question, though, that I'm hoping some folks here can answer for me. 

The thing I'm wondering is, how many of these ""rich people practices"" are the *cause* of wealth, and how many are the *effect*? Maybe they're self-reinforcing, but is this a chicken and egg thing? 

The reason I ask is that some of them seem very darn difficult to put into effect if you're poor. 

For example, number 14. How can someone only devote 50% of their income to monthly bills and expenses if they barely make enough to cover those things with 100% of their income? Of course it makes sense that someone with abundant income is going to put away some in various investments and savings - it's a lot easier to do that when the essentials are covered.

Number 5 also resonates with me: ""Opportunities, not obstacles"". Personally, every damn thing always seems like an obstacle, and the only way forward seems to be to overcome that obstacle and move on to the next most important thing on the list. It'd be great to grab hold of opportunities, but it feels a lot like picking daisies when you've got a pack of wolves chasing you. It's tough to de-prioritize the obstacle trouble-shooting.

To be clear, I'm not trying to crap all over this, I'm trying to understand, as a poor person who grew up in a family that practiced ""poor person habits"" by necessity, how I can pivot towards these practices?",ethical investing

Books like this and The Secret, are really good at two specific things, getting you to turn around your negative mindset and to whip you into a manic frenzy. Go to the seminar if you enjoy his style (he doesn't own the company any more). Take a course if you have the money. But please make zero mistake about it, these guys don't make money making you money, they make it taking it from you. And take if from you they will try. So why do I recommend going? I would not have started my business if I wasn't whipped into the ""manic frenzy"" I spoke of earlier. However, NOTHING they have to say has helped my business in any way. The truths they speak are pretty common. But does that mean you don't need to listen? Heck no, as a mentor of mine once said ""people don't need to be taught, they need to be reminded"". So go if you think this companies style is going to get you going. But what they got me in is a load of hot water. Platitudes will not equal sales. Luckily, I realized my mistake rather quickly after starting my business and got my shit together. Now I'm getting the business together. The success principles, the real ones, they are EVERYWHERE. We simply do not normally pay attention to them. Why? They're boring. If you're just starting out looking into wealth creation I'd say take owning a business seriously. If I'm not mistaken it's still the most reliable vehicle to wealth. But take it seriously. Owning a business fucking sucks. You think you know what stress is? You think you hate having two bosses? Try having two hundred. You think people are rational? You think you'll have free time? You think you'll ever not be at work? Well think again. And then again. And then again. And if you're sure you want to go for it then just go for it. Nine out of ten of your ideas will be wrong. Get used to it and keep going. 

Books I would recommend in the very beginning stages of considering wealth creation: 100 Ways to Create Wealth. The E-Myth. 9 Lies that are holding your business back. Basically anything Steve Chandler.

4itdcw,d31cpe1,PeruvianHeadshrinker,"Psychologist here: This is total crap.

First off, there is a good body of research that shows people who are born into wealth and resources develop these types of me-first ideas early on but it doesn't seem to actually generate that success. The victim-blaming mentality is also an artifact of that development and is strongly associated with attribution bias. A lot of these points also seem to be connected with being with the ""in-group"" and it is definitely the case that wealthy people associate with wealthy people--but that is not likely to be causal, it's probably an effect of circumstance and where you live/work. 

Secondly, I work and have worked with uber wealthy people in Silicon Valley and can tell you from firsthand experience that MANY wealthy people (especially those born into wealth):

1) They don't manage their wealth--they have someone else do it. But personally they are often totally unaware of the day to day stuff. Often, they have so much of it they don't even notice thousands of dollars being bilked from them by their staff. Even when they pay attention and penny pinch on the most ridiculous stuff, they will totally spend an extraordinary amount of money (way more than an average person's annual income) on something totally stupid they'll never use (I see this ALL the time and it drives 95% of the luxury market). Rich people are humans too and humans are pretty dumb when it comes to make decisions about money.


2) HNW people, often don't know their own net-worth (mostly because it's too complicated to figure out); these people are HIGHLY diversified in funds that are not transparent. They have no clue what they are worth; they may get some amount on paper from the accountant every year for tax purposes but so much of their worth is unrealized and that's how they think of it, but they genuinely have no clue.

3) Rich people are scared and reactive as much as the next person. Trust me, I know, I see them in therapy and they are just like you and me. They don't have some magical anti-fear super power. That's total bullshit.

4) Many of the points read like aspersions on wealthy people; it sounds a LOT more like a narcissist than a rich person. To be sure there are rich narcissists, but there are also poor narcissists (I've worked with them too). I know MANY people of HNW:

* who care a lot about others, 
* are focused on giving their wealth away (Bill Gates anyone?), 
* don't see money as the end goal (more as a by-product), 
* focus on the small (there's a lot more leverage in niche areas than giant markets), 
* recognize obstacles more than you may think (that's the primary purpose of due diligence--they don't ""work harder"" they find the path of least resistance--that is almost entirely obstacle focused),
* and pay others based on an agreement (which is not always on end-product focused). 


Sorry to OP if it sounds like I'm jumping down your throat, I appreciate your time in writing this up. I get irked about stuff like this because I really see in very subtle ways that it actually LIMITS people's potential.


Also, I would like to add the whole thoughts create feelings thing is a little misleading (depending on how you define thoughts). Conscious thought is more often driven by feelings (which you could argue is a thought--activity of the mind) rather than vice versa. It's true you can trick yourself into feeling something but this is actually pretty hard to do consistently without building habits and actually paying attention to the feeling underneath (EQ). This is the kind of work I do with HNW execs to fully bring to bear the power of their mind-body and personally what I think is the biggest X factor in generating successful people (beyond being in good circumstance).

""Rich people think big."" Ah, no. Most people with money work the small stuff. You don't overpay for things and think twice about buying a BMW when a Toyota will do. Advising folks on their way up to ""think big"" sounds like you're licensing them to covet / acquire ""rich peoples' stuff"" before they have the actual wherewithal to do so. That way disaster lies.

""Rich people choose to get paid based on results (vs. poor: based on time).""  Your earning structure makes no real difference. Many people with money file timesheets every week/month. What matters is that you achieve the credibility to justify what you charge, however you charge it. That often calls for various kinds of sacrifices.

""Rich people focus on their net worth (vs. poor: working income)."" Actually, most people with money absolutely focus on monthly budgets and income/outflow trends; that's how you build a net worth to begin with. If you sit around admiring your brokerage statements rather than managing the smallball items, you're endangering yourself.

Some other observations on this list are more valid. ""Rich people"" (what is ""rich,"" anyway?) ""create their lives,"" while ""poor people"" (I don't like that term either) say ""life happens to me."" Too pat, especially while most of us are neither ""rich"" nor ""poor.""

I know some lovely people, long-time friends, who have accumulated much less than they're capable of because of these factors.

But at the end of the day it is terrible advice to tell people who are trying to accumulate money to think big, dream large, ignore risk, ""live in a world of abundance,"" be ""bigger than your problems"" (which when you think about is exactly the same thing as avoiding your problems -- you have to TACKLE your problems), etc. Some early-stage wealth-builders are going to read this and go out and buy McMansions and fancy cars and fly first class everywhere.

This is red flag number one. Any proposal of success that starts with something as vapid as ""thoughts"" is going to charge you a ton of money to learn how to ""thoughts"" correctly. This guy even has two steps that are non-actionable.

> There is an actual dollar amount for which many of us are programmed (and this can cause limitation).

Red flag two. If you pay him and his company he'll ""reprogram you"" to a higher ""actual dollar amount.""

Again, no real action necessary. Just read this stuff and attend those things and whammo, now you can sit around and ""thoughts"" correctly until your ship comes in!

> Rich people believe ""I create my life."" (vs poor: ""Life happens to me."" Play the role of the victim, justify their circumstances, complain). There is no such thing as a really rich victim.

This is a sucker filter. The book wants people who are (a) feeling like they are victims of life and (b) want to change that. So naturally, ""rich"" people are in control and ""poor"" people are victims. People who don't match (a) or (b) are going to be a lot more resistant to the spiel.

> Rich people play the money game to win (vs poor: just don't lose - have enough to pay the bills, or to be comfortable). Goal of rich is to have massive wealth and abundance.

This is [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). The only rich people who play to win are those who won -- otherwise they would be poor.

> Rich people are committed (""to devote oneself unreservedly"") to being rich (vs. poor: want to be rich, but have negative thoughts of rich). ""The number one reason most people don't get what they want is that they don't know what they want."" Rich are fully committed; will do whatever legal, moral, ethical thing that it takes to have wealth.

This is the first mention of hard work. But it is carefully hidden next to the ""they don't know what they want"" bullshit. It's a primer to make people ask, ""Wait, what do I really want?"" in an environment that is about to tell them what they want. (Spoiler: What you want is to pay the author for things and services.)

> Rich people think BIG (vs poor: small). The Law of Income: You will be paid in direct proportion to the value you deliver according to the marketplace. Your life is not only about you; it is also about contributing to others.

The first sentence isn't related to the second sentence. The real danger in this one is it can promote ""big dreams"" which aren't actually actionable. ""Think of BIG successes"" is not the same thing as ""pursue BIG successes.""

> Rich people focus on opportunities (vs poor: obstacles). ""Rich take responsibility for the results in their lives and act upon the mindset, 'It will work because I will make it work.' "" Expect to succeed. Take educated risks; do research without stalling. Focus on what you want; focus on all opportunities.

""Focus on all opportunities"" is the opposite of what the word ""focus"" means. But this is a repeat of #1.

> Rich people admire other rich and successful people (vs poor: resent them). Your opinions make no difference about the wealth others have; they are dis-empowering you. Try on these characteristics: positive, reliable, focused, determined, persistent, hardworking, energetic, good with people, competent communicator, semi-intelligent, expert in at least one area. ""Bless that which you want.""

Haha, ""I'm rich and you should bless me.""

Also, FWIW, the few truly rich people I know hate some other rich people. They are extremely competitive and can easily resent success when it flows away from them.

> Rich people associate with positive, successful people (vs poor: negative & unsuccessful). The fastest and easiest way to create wealth is to learn from rich people. Energy is contagious: either affect or infect others & visa versa.

""I am rich and letting you associate with me for a small fee. See how nice I am being?""

""Association"" is another non-action similar to ""thoughts"".

1. When I was young, I was poor. Life happened to me a whole lot. Life was constantly happening to me. I'm the very same person I was then, only I have more money, yet now I feel as though I create my own life. Am I a different person, or do I simply have more money? 

2. I'm not playing the game to win as that assumes that someone else is the loser. I like not having to worry about money. However, I also like spending time with my family, hanging out with friends, or hiking. I hate this fucking metaphor of how life is like a game, because the very American way of thinking is that the game is one-on-one basketball. Life isn't like that...at least not for me. 

3. Rich people are devoted unreservedly to being rich. IMO counterproductive BS. This is the kind of talk to get weak minded people greedy enough to give you their hard earned money.

4. The Law of Income. This assumes that you know what the marketplace values. No one knows what the marketplace values until it is valued. Also, the market is fickle. There is no Law of Income, but perhaps there is a theory of income.

5. 'It will work because I will make it work"". I guess I have the attitude of a poor person and have somehow gotten lucky or maybe just a good saver. I'm older, and I've failed a lot. Hell, I've failed more often than I've succeeded. The best advice I've received is that it is okay to fail as long as you learn from it.

4itdcw,d318xk7,RockyK,"Thank you Op - for the resource! I'm skimming through the comments, and it's fascinating! Many of them come from a place where they tried something (possibly from a book just like this), and it didn't work. That itself is the problem. 

Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, Rich Dad Poor Dad, and all the other self-help to get financially wealthy books all try to be 'step-by-step' guides, but they're not. They're just not. The author is an outlier. Something happened, and they made a lot of wealth. If you tried to follow that exact same formula, there's no gaurantee of success. It's foolish to think they are.

What they do provide is a different mindset - a different way of thinking. 

I grew up in the ghetto. My dad has been unemployed for 30+ years, and my mom works about minimum wage. Most of my family, relatives, etc - barely make $10-15 an hour. That's what I was looking forward to when I graduated out of high school. When I wrapped up college, I was excited to be making $14 an hour. That's just what we poor people expect. 

Then I started reading all sorts of success books. Then I realized the 'cycle of proverty' that my family was accepting. I stopped complaining, and started working with actual successful people. A few years later, I doubled my salary (I make 4 times as much as my mom). When I visit my family, it's really difficult. I try my best to break them out of the 'i hope this lottery ticket saves me' mentality - but they don't want change. They just want to complain.

I agree with #4 (you get paid in proportion to your value to others), #8 (rich people are willing to promote themselves and their value), and probably #10 (rich people are willing to receive), #14 (rich people manage their money well). and #15 (rich people put their money to work). #14 might be a tautology though.

I probably agree with the concepts of #13 (rich people focus on new worth), but disagree with the way the author states it.

While in theory I agree with #16 (rich people act in spite of fear), these words are typically used to separate suckers from money. Rich people may act in spite of fear, but they are also wise about when to act and when not to act.

4itdcw,d31f4qu,,"Sorry OP. This list is full of weapons grade bullshit.

The way that the author talks about ""rich vs poor"" you'd almost think it's a lifestyle choice. Almost as if he's talking about choosing a political party.

Let's be real for a second. Rich people - the truly rich - are hoarders. That's the truth. They hoard money. You can wax poetic all day about how to get in to the hoarding mindset and how they got such a big haul, but it misses the point completely.

Capital is a zero-sum game. If I have a classroom full of 10 people, and I have 100 dollars, and one student takes 60 dollars to himself, it's fundamentally (almost axiomatically) impossible for any other student to have that much. I don't care what their attitude is.

OK, the real world is more complicated. I get it. There's the Fed. There's investment. Inflation. Blah blah blah. It doesn't change the basic fact that wealthy people get wealthy through a process of *wealth extraction*. Not *wealth creation*, *wealth extraction*.

I'm saying all this to point out something that I would hope is obvious: Rich people don't want to share their success. Rich people are cutthroat. They thrive on winner-take-all competitions. It's an *exclusive* and *ever-shrinking* club. You have the same odds of joining their ranks through ""good thoughts"" and ""hard work"" as being able to fly by believing in yourself and flapping your arms really really hard.

Poor people aren't victims. They're an inevitability. You can't get richer without making someone else poorer. For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. The equation has to balance.

This is basic stuff, OP. A 4th grader could come up with what I'm saying. The stuff listed above varies between ""well duh"" to plain magical thinking. E.g. Obviously it's important to have confidence in yourself, to have a growth mindset, etc. But certain items (e.g. number 13) seem to imply that if you *think* like them (or prioritize things like them), you'll *become* them, which is just dumb and wrong.

What if being rich was largely predicated on (a) the circumstances of your birth, (b) who you know, (c) life circumstances beyond your control (e.g. the stock market), and (d) your willingness to extract wealth from others for your own gain (i.e. unapologetic greed)? I suppose I'll give a mention to ""charisma"" as well since you can't just openly portray yourself like that, a certain amount of showmanship and grace is expected to operate in public (and to manipulate people, obviously).

But then I guess that wouldn't sell as many books, would it?

**EDIT**

It occurs to me that I'm portraying one end of a spectrum. Of course there are Rich people out there who don't fit this mold, whose money isn't ill-gotten. But the book's unwillingness to acknowledge certain realities (and paint all Rich people as the epitome of the good thought and good intentions) still bothers me.

f7svbw,fiery1b,thelurkerinthemidst,"First, I am USA-based. You will need to 'translate' what I say to be meaningful to you (as an example, I will be talking about retirement accounts. I think Latvia has private retirement accounts, but I got lost...).

You should aim for five types of accounts:

1) checking account. This generally holds money to pay for your expenses for the next one or two months. 

2) emergency fund. The two rules of thumb are ""it should be $1000"" (for the baby steps portion of the Dave Ramsey plan) and ""it should be six months of expenses"" (which is really a shortcut. If you lose your job, how long will it take to replace that income? Your emergency fund needs to cover that, as well as any deductibles and unexpected maintenance. Six months of expenses works for most people.) It is generally in cash or a cash equivalent. It is a type of insurance, and you don't try to earn anything on it. CDs can be used if there isn't a penalty for cashing them in early or if the cash portion of the fund can cover you until you can cash the CD in.

3) retirement funds. These are to fund your retirement after you retire. This should probably be invested in a stock market index fund (recommendations here tend to be along the lines of a blend of total US stock market, total International Stock market, total US bonds. I don't know what equivalents there are for Latvia).

4) intermediate expenses fund. This is used to save for expected but non-monthly expenses within a five year time frame. House maintenance, vehicle maintenance, birthdays, vacations, down payments, etc will get paid out of this. Since most expenses this is designed to cover are five or fewer years, it should be in a high yield savings account, investment grade bonds, CDs, or mutual fund in one of those. Since you need the cash within five years, none of this should be invested in stocks/funds/real estate (the risk of it going down in value and not recovering by the time you need the money is too high). It covers many things that shouldn't be emergencies but are treated as one (at some point, you will need to replace the tires. Plan for it.)

5) long term investment account. This is to supplement the other funds. It is where you start putting savings for the house you will buy in 10 years. It is how you pay for the cruise you suddenly stumbled on and hadn't saved for. It is what lets you retire when you are 42 and can't pull from your retirement account. Since most of these are more than five years out, this is normally invested in the stock market. A portion may be in CDs to provide stability and make it safer to supplement the other funds.",ethical investing

Tiny life advice like this is great at helping us optimize the path we are on and making good from the circumstances we are presented, but it isn't going to make you rich or apply universally, which is always the implication with ""this is how I got successful"" anecdotes.

 I know people who do everything you suggested to a tee and are certainly no where near $1mil and can't practically get there due to their circumstances they were born into (but they do well for themselves). I know people who do none of what you suggest and are incredibly wealthy. This might just be a bay area thing but the drugs part made me giggle a little in particular. Every rich dude or financially successful person I know around here has done drugs harder than weed (but not truly bad shit like coke/heroin). Nobody abuses it though, and the people they do it with are smart peers instead of wasters. Again, maybe a bay area thing where drug use is a lot less taboo and much more normalized.

Point is, stuff like this is easy to read as inspirational path to success but the reality is that it is survivorship bias. At least when presented in the way the OP is doing - ""I'm wealthy and this is why"".",ethical investing

6l6taz,djrkrqj,h_lance,">getting that bachelors in Art is probably not going to pay off.

I'm guessing you're a physician in a country other than US or Canada, then, with a six year medical school program straight out of high school.

In US and Canada we go to medical school after college - almost always after completing a bachelors degree.

If you want to go to medical school you need to do the required course work, get high grades, and do well on the MCAT.  

But undergraduate major is basically irrelevant.

There were English majors and Art History majors in my top twenty US medical school class.  

I majored in Biology, but because I wanted to.  I love Art History but I can learn that on my own more easily, and I also loved Biology.

Here is how undergraduate major should be chosen in my view - 

1) If you have the academic talent to go on to a valuable professional degree, choose whatever major you find most interesting and excel in it, and do well on standardized tests.  If it happens to be electrical engineering great, but with a high GPA and high standardized test scores, you can also move on to medical school, other health care professional degrees like PA or physical therapy, good MBA program, top law school, etc.  Grades and test scores matter, not major.

2) If you're academically about average, you can't be sure that your education won't end at the bachelors level or only a bit above.  This is where degrees that are qualifications at the undergraduate level, like accounting and many types of engineering, nursing, etc, are the most valuable, because even if your grades and test scores are only okay by competitive standards, you gain marketable skills.  For this group major is critical.  A philosophy major with a 3.8 GPA, a high MCAT score, and good grades in required pre-med courses is in as good shape as anybody.  But an accounting major with a 2.8 GPA is typically far better off than a philosophy major with a 2.8 GPA in terms of immediate job opportunities.

3) Obviously, among the people who should go to college, some have to be below average academically relative to other people in college.  This is obvious.  If you put Albert Einstein, Leonardo DaVinci, and Shakespeare together in an invertebrate biology class, and make the exams hard enough to differentiate, one of them has to get the worst grade.  Somebody has to be.  If you can't get high grades and also have a hard time with majors like accounting or engineering, just get the degree that you are best able to get.  Having a degree at all is still far better than dropping out.",ethical investing

While I think this information isn't exactly a secret (a lot of good advice isn't a secret, just hard to stick to), everyone commenting ""change doctor to [insert job w/ salary<doctor salary] and you'll have my attention"" I think are looking at this post in the wrong light.

I'm personally interested in how OP took their first steps and how they went through the decision process of setting goals. That's information that's very valuable and not easy to find because these type of goals are different and subjective to each person that attempts to set them. 

So formally to OP: 

1. What decision process did you use to find and set your goals? And what problems did you come across in this process? Are there any resources you'd recommend in financial goal setting? 

2. While there are a lot of resources made known on this subreddit, how did you educate yourself in financial literacy, and what resources/services/tools did you use? How long did it take you before you considered yourself more or less literate in personal finance? 

Lastly, great job OP. You set a goal that took a decade to attain, and one that is not easy. Not many people can stick to their New Years resolutions let alone stuck to a very difficult and large goal such as this one. Congrats OP!",ethical investing

6l6taz,djrzod1,stmfreak,"Thank you for your post. I'm sorry you deleted it since I wanted to show it to my kids. It closely mirrors the best practices I've followed to improve my income and financial health.

I guess we should not be surprised that the vast majority of responses are looking at your presumed high income as the easy path to saving a million bucks; while missing the very advice that put you on that path and kept you there through all the various hardships that we encounter over time.

I'm always baffled at this response since this forum often has advice from the seemingly wealthy, saying, ""here is how I did it. you can too!"" Without fail, those most in need of the advice say, ""that doesn't work. I'm not already rich like you.""

Here is how I became ""wealthy"" for some definitions thereof:

1. Study every day, always learn new things.
2. Learn how to manage your finances. Making more money won't fix them.
3. Don't work hard at your current job. Work hard getting to your next, higher paying job.

I could go on and on about avoiding drugs and alcohol, finding good friends and influences on your life (spouse being the major one) instead of hanging out with detractors that keep you from moving ahead. But those three would be a good start, I think, for most people at any level of income.

Regardless, I expect we'll hear a lot of excuses about my ""privilege,"" how poor people don't have free time to study, working three jobs at $4 per hour to make less money than is mathematically possible for said claim. There are many who are not ready for the advice yet.

But some of the readers are. Some people are taking away a few ideas to apply to their own life. And I expect they'll be back in ten years to tell others how ""they did it"" only to also be shot down as being born into opportunity and privilege. I look forward to their stories.

1) Have you talked to your therapist about work? Have you talked to the therapist about people talking behind your back? I would imagine that your boss should support your flexible work arrangement instead of people talking about you, and your therapist may help you with how to productively talk to your manager about it.

I am looking at Toyota Tacoma double cabs on Carvana right now, from 2015, and they are around 22k plus. That's the range you should look for.

&#x200B;

For the house, what do you want? Do you plan to have kids? If not, do you plan to have roommates or eventually a significant other that would move in? That's how you can decide what to buy. Remember that a home has a LOT of upfront costs - furnishing, upgrades, etc etc. So be aware of that when thinking of buying.

Home's aren't cheap after you move in.  Furniture, dishes, maintenance, appliances, etc. etc.  It will add up in a hurry.

Keep driving your existing car until you’re done with school or the repairs are too costly / commonplace.

If you want a car, go get a car. However, I cannot support paying $40k for a vehicle. I bought a used 2016 Mazda6 for $13k and sometimes I kick myself for it. You can definitely find a Tacoma for much cheaper than that. I threw a random FL zip code on CarGurus (Gainesville, go Gators!) and I'm seeing many 2012-2016 Tacomas for <$20k. Is this more of a need or a want? How long is your commute? Can you consider something with more MPG?

As long as you keep your car clean, no woman is going to judge you for anything. If they do, you don't want to date them anyway. I met my current girlfriend driving a 2006 Mercury Milan worth about $2k that was beat the fuck up and sounded like a boat. She didn't care much. 

As for the house, well, I'd recommend maybe going to school, getting the NP and paying off the car before even thinking about that. It's just too expensive and as an NP your income will double. My cousin finished hers from Walden (fully online except for clinicals) a couple of years ago, and while Walden is a for-profit school, it is accredited and she was able to take her boards and find a job. As long as you're licensed, no one will care where you got your degree from (specifically in the health field).  The program was about $40k total. There are many other schools that offer it fully online too.",ethical investing

I’d go for a used Tacoma thats $25k or less and pay cash. 

I’d move out of your parents house. You are a grown man making a good income you don’t need to be living at home. 

My rule for homes is not to buy a home where the 15 year fixed rate payment (mortgage taxes and insurance) do not exceed 25% of your take home pay (pay after taxes). So you can either buy cheaper or give a larger down payment to make that happen. 
15 year payments have you building equity in your home at a better rate. 30 year mortgages basically cost you more in interest than the house gains in value so it ends up being a total drain on your wealth not a solid asset. 

Keeping the payments low also allow you do cashflow things like a masters program or vacations. When you over buy in a home it sucks up all your discretionary income and your house ends up owning you.

&#x200B;

I have made many financial mistakes in my life, and you sound as if you're doing very well, so it's a bit presumptuous of me to advise you, but my gut reaction is ""don't buy a house."" As someone else said, you may meet the woman of your dreams and her job may take you elsewhere. You, yourself, are currently contemplating a career path that may mean your current workplace won't make the most sense for you any more. You are working full time + an extra shift every week now, and you are contemplating adding what is probably a demanding program of coursework to that. Houses, especially when you are the only resident, take a tremendous amount of time...and it doesn't sound like time is something you'll have much of. And you are monetarily locked into them until you can rent or sell them. Your income is good, but definitely not going to allow you to carry two mortgages if you need to move. What if you get your Nurse Practitioner program finished and get offered the position of your dreams but it's 1500 miles away? Is your plan to be an absentee landlord?

If I were you, I'd rent for a bit and try out living in different places around your city. See if you actually want to live in the neighborhood your parents are recommending. Find out what you like. Find out where the young people and women that you like tend to congregate. Plus, as a huge bonus, you can focus on work and school and if your pipes spring a leak at 3 am, you just make a phone call and then it's someone else's problem. 

Or if you're set on purchasing, I'd look at something like a condo that includes maintenance for the same reason. Moving into a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house by yourself is an awful lot of maintenance, lawn mowing, tree planting, and (depending upon your area) snow removal. 

Just my 2 cents. The good news is you have made great choices up to now. If you'd like to buy yourself a nicer car, I'd say, pay cash, make sure you price out the insurance payment first, get one that's a few years old, and enjoy the fruits of your labor.",ethical investing

It's an okay temporary solution. Your wife makes more money. The doctor gets to keep your wife from leaving. Everyone will be happy. Temporarily.

Sooner or later, it's going to stop feeling like it's working. Best case scenario, she keeps mostly working with the doctor she likes, and nothing else gets worse. But her paychecks from the clinic aren't going to get appreciably better, either. And it sounds like her workload isn't likely to improve any time soon.

3pr7pd,cw8plmx,FP-Guy,"Hi conkersbadhairday

I'm a Financial Adviser in Sydney and I'll give you a few options. But before I do, you need to sit down and work out:

* how much you want to invest?
* can you contribute more to it on an ongoing basis?
* what time frame do you need access to it?

So when you work out those 3 questions, then you'll be able to work out what type of investments might be suitable. But let's assume you got 5 years and you plan to save for a house maybe the goal is $150 to $200 as a deposit.

Generally people need between 10k to 20k as a emergency fund. So lets say $15k. So now we have $50k you want to invest. Let's also say you can add $10k to it per annum. Now the tough part is over, you still have to determine what type of investments might be suitable:

* Term deposits?
if you want to get access to your money soon within 1-2 years. Sure. But over that time-frame there are better investments. Keep this in mind right now we have low interest rates at around maybe 3%. If you're familiar with CPI and we say it's at 2.5%, then your money really only grows in value by 0.5%(if invested in term deposits)

So now maybe you want to consider to invest in shares. Here's what you need to workout. 
* Do you want to choose the shares yourself?
If you do then, you can goto a broker(by this i mean set up an account online like CommSec or NABTrade) and load your money into the account. Then you simply select to PLACE 'Buy' orders(where you select the price you want to pay for the shares) or 'Sell' orders (where you state the price you're willing to pay). But you have to decide on the shares to Buy. 

Maybe you don't want to pick the shares?

You can enter into a managed fund, ETF (etc) where the fund manager will charge you a fee but will invest the money for you. Anywhere from 0.25% to 1.5% of the total balance you invest. You can read about the funds performance and find out if they have a good track record.

So let's say you invest $50k and add $10k every year. And you invest your money and it earns 7.5% per annum.

Year 1:
$50,000 - balance
$3,750 - growth/investment income
$10,000 - contributions

Year 2
$63,750 - balance
$4,781 - growth/investment income
$10,000 - contributions

Year 3
$78,531 - balance
$5,990 - growth/investment income
$10,000 - contributions

Year 4
$94,420 - balance
$7,081 - growth/investment income
$10,000 - contributions

Year 5
$111,501 - balance
$8,362 - growth/investment income
$10,000 - contributions

End of 5 years
$129,863 - Balance

So while we didn't hit $150,000 - we came close. But can you see that the higher the balance amounts to, the faster the balance grows. That's the  key. But if you don't continue to add contributions to help the investments grow you may miss out on the overall growth.",ethical investing

First, Robo-investing is the best way to invest if you are looking to maximize your returns, period.

On the flip side, I think there many different contrarian ways to invest, and it all depends on your goals and risk profile.

Everyone discounting his story as ""Just get a 100k salary"" is very conveniently overlooking the fact that OP took action to increase his employable skills, therefore making himself a better qualified applicant for higher salaried positions. 

Listen, I get it -- if you're struggling and frustrated - it SUCKS to read a story about a guy who turned it around, especially if you've been kicked a few times. However I say fuck that. I'm calling that out as a bullshit attitude: for many of us, the hardest thing to do is to admit that YOU CAN BE DOING MORE TO IMPROVE YOUR OWN FINANCIAL SITUATION. It's very easy to shift the blame to external forces and downplay our own culpability. When it comes to finance, it's easy to adopt that ""victim"" mindset. Hell, many people ARE victims of the status quo...no denying that fact. HOWEVER, to dismiss OP's testimony as some sort of hoax or bullshit seems to me like an easy way to keep oneself in a feedback loop of your OWN bullshit. Sick of being broke? GOOD.

3yw5yk,cyh8zvu,Brandencheeseburger,"To all the people saying this is bullshit, my boyfriend of 4 years had a very similar experience:

1. At the end of 2011, he was making $10/hr, 19 hours a week in the DFW area in TX
2. He gave up all his hobbies temporarily in order to focus on learning some new skills in order to make more money to pay back his student loan bills and credit cards (he'd become something like 6 months behind on them for various reasons I won't go into here). Initially he focused on becoming a system administrator but shifted to programming after hearing good things from a few of his friends.
3. After about a year of practicing/reading/immersing himself in the programming world, His job offered to increase his hours to 30/week, but he was required to put together a resume to keep on file to be eligible. He figured since he put his resume together, there was no harm in sending it around to a few companies. He wasn't feeling very confident but he found a contracting job doing web development on Craigslist and sent an email to them offering to work for $15/hour (seemed huge to us at the time).
4. After working there as a contractor for 10 months, the work started drying up so he found a new job making 50k initially and salaried at a startup in town. Within a few months, through hard work and late hours, he was given a raise to 70k.
5. Roughly a year later that same company decided to open a San Francisco office and my boyfriend volunteered to help them. The company was very young and needed the help so they took him up on his offer and brought his salary up to 120k after he negotiated up from their initial offer of 100k (living expenses are much higher in the Bay Area than TX and he didn't want to hurt his ability to save and pay off debt)
6. After a few months, that company was struggling to get their SF operations going so he changed jobs and got a bump to 130k, but with much fewer hours and less stress than the previous company.
7. He excelled there and was able to get a raise to 140k after working there for a year, and then, a few months later, another bump to 150k and a promotion to management.

Not saying this is anywhere near a typical experience someone can expect, but I definitely believe the OP is capable of going from 0-100k if he worked hard in the startup world. To those wondering about degrees, etc., my boyfriend majored in Asian Studies, dropped out of college and didn't get a degree. At least in software development, this hasn't seemed to hurt his career or advancement opportunities, but it probably did hurt his ability to get that first gig. He got lucky there that someone was willing to take a risk on someone without a degree or formal experience.

All that said, congratulations OP and good on you for achieving so much in so little time.",ethical investing

My statement is based on the fact that you said ""I'm interested in doing this for a living"". If you weren't interested, sell it. But if you have any interest at all, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. You can truly share some memorable bonding time with your father before he's gone forever, and if it works out, you can carry on the business, which will help with the grieving process. Above all, spend a lot of time with your dad. Let him know what he meant to you. Use the time you have with him wisely, as it's running out. I miss my dad all the time. ",ethical investing
3w34im,cxt0fv6,,"I have my own company on the finance side of commercial real estate. I started out in the industry doing financial and market analysis for $40m+ brokerage transactions across the country from malls to office complexes to apartment buildings and finally hotels or ""hospitality"". CRE brokerage, hotels in particular, has been popping for the past year and will continue to do so for a couple years.

That being said, it is a 100% relationship and industry knowledge business. It is also a very cutthroat business, because the financial rewards are so high. Brokers are very hard, very selfish, and very clever people from years of grinding, and you can read that in a man very quickly in a business setting.  Honestly, brokers have next to no loyalties.  

Because it is so relationship and knowledge specific, there are not a lot of buyers. Without your dad, you really have nothing to sell.

If you want to keep the business going, you are going to have to bringing in a partner that has industry experience that you can control.  You are basically going to have to bootcamp on the hotel industry and make up years of training.

This was quick and dirty. I will PM you. Give you a reading list if this is something that you want to pursue. 

Edit- Lot of PMs for reading material on brokerage. You really have to work under someone that has already made it inorder to be successful, and those positions are hard to find because they are fundamentally training future competition. If you would like to learn about investing, Commercial Real Estate Analysis & Investments by Geltner is the Bible. 

80% of people that try to be CRE brokers fail in the first year. There is no salary. You have to have more than one, preferably more, of one of the following to be successful:
1. Your family has a large portfolio of CRE
2. You socialize with HNW individuals. ~$20m+
3. You went to the right school 
4. You are a white male 
5. You are a former Pro/Olympic athlete
6. You have an investment banking background

This is a conservative environment full of racism and sexism.  I came into it from investment banking because the hours are way better.  There was still a learning curve, because so much of it is intangible. ",ethical investing

3w34im,cxsz41x,ilooovebacon,"Since you don't have any experience in the industry, it would probably be easier to either sell or close the business if a buyer can't be found.  

If you want to keep the business, you will probably have to hire someone with your dad's qualifications to run the business for you.  If you can find someone to do that, then they could train you in the business while you apply for the realty license (no clue how long it takes to obtain one - I know nothing about real estate).  It could be a good scenario if you can find the right person.

Either way you go, it will probably not be easy.  I think sometimes people get rose-colored glasses about being self-employed. But actually, when you are the boss it means you have to be willing to work harder than everyone else, and be responsible for the business's success or failure.  Running a business is hard.  Selling is hard too, because you have to find a qualified buyer.  Whatever you decide, I wish you the best of luck.

3w34im,cxte5u0,Canadaismyhat,"I hate to come in and sound like an asshole because all the answers are clearly sincere, but I need to get straight to the point without mincing words: No one here has any idea what they're talking about. 

Bankers, real estate brokers, and assorted people with random business backgrounds have zero experience or knowledge of business brokerage. 

I have experience, but even I can't give you definitive answers without knowing a great deal of information first. It's (probably, depends) unlikely you'll be able to sell the business outright; you would have to find someone capable and structure the terms on a contingency basis, i.e. you turn over current listings and get 50% of proceeds from them followed by 25% of proceeds from leads generated for a period of 12 months or whatever the case may be. 

If you enjoy financial planning and make a career of it I hope you're the happiest person on the planet, but for almost everyone it's a shitty career path and I would rather gouge my eyes out with an ice pick. Financial planning vs business brokerage is literally no different than comparing a cook at McDonald's to Gordon Ramsay.

You would have to be a certain kind of crazy person to take over the business and run it, but that's what I would do. Let the admin go immediately, take over the office, and start cramming to learn the sale process. 60-80 hour weeks for a couple months should be enough to give you a fighting chance at surviving in the industry going forward, but you would have to go way beyond your comfort zone and be a tremendously dynamic and business-oriented person by nature. 

Unless you're going to light a fire under yourself and completely commit your life to this path, try to get someone to assume the businesses' outstanding responsibilities in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds. This is not about the money, it's about concluding the business that's already been started. Business brokerage is very difficult to get out of.

3w34im,cxt2t37,garythecoconut,"I can give you some advice as someone who runs a couple companies and has run others in the past as well. I want to take a bit off a different approach than everyone else though. 

Running a company is very difficult and time consuming (I run 2 currently). I start working when I wake up at about 8 AM and finish working at about 10-11 PM every night. I do take sundays off. That is just how I like to do it.

So, you can only pull that kinda demand for something if you really LOVE it, and are very passionate about it. There has to be some other motivation other than money in order to continue demanding that much performance from yourself. So if you were just thinking of running the company for a salary, I would say you should find a business broker and sell it. Because that isn't enough motivation to put up with all the headaches of running a company.

So I want to look at your situation a little differently. If you love the company and are passionate about it, then that is a good indicator that you should do it. Let's look a little deeper too:

Do you have goals for the company? do you have ideas of how to make it grow, and improve the process and product? Do you have an idea of what type of people you would like to work with and hire? Is that a position that would excite you and give you a sense of purpose?

If your feelings are excited about my comment and you have answers to the questions I proposed, then I would encourage you to keep the company and give it a shot. You can figure out all the pieces and details along the way. Don't be intimidated that it is going to be difficult. Believe in your capabilities and you can rise to the goals you set for yourself.

Another thing to think about, what would your dad's wishes be? If he is leaving it to you, you should manage his gift in the way that would make him proud of you. What I am saying is don't sell the company and spend it all on gambling or some other wasteful thing. What ever you decide, manage it well and in a way that your dad would be proud of you for, and you cannot lose. :)

What a great gift for a dad to leave his son. I hope to be able to leave something great behind for my children someday. 

Good luck!",ethical investing

Look it up, but the basics are, your father needs to set up a board of directors, and make sure that it isn't controlled by family members. Maybe out of seven people there should be one person in the family. Most people should be associates in the real estate or related industry that can lend their expertise. Don't fill it with employees of the company. These people should have little financial interest in the company, but do need to be compensated for their efforts.

More info is here: https://www.sba.gov/content/plan-your-exit

These people will be charged with hiring executives and employees for the company. They will have authority to hire and fire that executive and pass goals for the company. Remember, the goal of the succession plan is to provide stability for the business and stable income for his designated heirs.

It is a good time to setup a will or trust, if he has not done so. Dont postpone. Going to probate court is a waste of time and money.

I am not sure how lucid your dad is, but having him explain you how the business work can be a great form of bonding for you two, if the business mean a lot to him. 

Cherish these moments with him, and even if the business die, making him feel like he left something worthwhile for you will mean a lot to him. 

Record the conversations so you can play it back later on and remember his voice. Once it is gone, your memory will slowly fade and you will miss hearing it. 

In the end it is just $$ and experience. Everything you do will make you a better person, if your motives are true to yourself. Running a company is a skill that will translate into everything you do. A lot of it is basic common sense and exercise of discipline and self control.

3w34im,cxu9cso,BrownEggsandBacon,"Sorry that I assumed in the prior email that you were male. And while looks are an advantage in any industry, it takes much more than looks to be a broker. Most of them don't apparently missed the kindergarten lessons of playing nicely and sharing. So you not only have to have the contacts, experience and work ethic, but your personality has to match the profession.
More questions: Do you have a hotel degree? Did you also go to the school where your father endowed the scholarship?  Does the contractor have a broker license instead of an associate license? How successful is the contractor?
A two person firm probably doesn't have the clout to keep going successfully if your father passes. There's not enough momentum there. And if the contractor isn't bringing in deals of their own, with their own name recognition and list of clients then, well, that person may not be able to run things on their own. Deals take a LONG-assed time to close, and it takes more than a few of them in a row to get name recognition. You will be competing with scores of established brokers. And those brokers will be hard selling your father's clients once he passes. I think you need to recognize that brokerage is a relationship business that takes years to make profitable.
Thinking you may benefit from your father's clients and the good will he has garnered from endowing a scholarship?  It only goes so far. While people who liked your dad may well want to help you, they can't risk significant assets with an unknown. A good broker may make the client literally millions more than a less experienced one. Those people may feel a sense of obligation to help you bc they respected your dad but that goes only so far. Further, endowing a scholarship is small potatoes in the philanthropy world. I have a friend who works at an Ivy League college soliciting donations. About 5 years ago, she told me that giving a million dollars doesn't even necessarily get any recognition from the top dogs. Lunch the dean, yes; dinner with the president, no way. 
Lastly, I'm assuming you have graduated college. You went into the financial services field after graduation, not the hotel broker field working for your dad. That tells me something about what you really had on your mind before your dad became ill. Perhaps hotel brokerage is not your true calling?

It is an aviation company. She knew nothing in terms of management, licensing, certifications, ratings, the whole lot. It wasn't what she learned to do. She jumped right into it and the company still exists today with me learning my way there. She juggled an extremely busy schedule without time to mourn with technically zero experience (aside from it being an aviation company) and 4 kids with the oldest being 6 and a half and this is just a month after her mum (my grandma) passed away due to a fall. Why? because it is important to her that the company survives and it is important to her that we, her children not suffer a QoL drop.

Why did I mention that? simple buddy. If you have to ask, you have to do. When it's a no, it's a clear no. You want to but you dare not simply because of being inexperience. Go for it but go in with an open heart. Go in willing to be wrong and willing to learn, willing to apologize but willing to take charge. I wanted to at least go through some of what my mum had to deal with and opened 5 companies from the age of 18-29 whilst juggling education and my god it was hard. These companies were in fields I had zero understanding of but put yourself out there, take advise, ask questions with all the authorities involved, get to know people, make time, sit down, chat and trust me, you'll get to where you need to be today, tomorrow (well not technically tomorrow but ya know, catchy catchy).

Are you your father's executor? If so, probate may require you to take on the responsibilities of running the business until everything moves through probate.

Have you discussed with him the state of his affairs? Any unpaid taxes, personal loans, mortages, or outstanding payments on vehicles you don't know about? Where does he keep his personal banking info, passwords, taxes filed for the business and himself? Any outstanding medical bills? If he has a safe deposit box, can you access it?

Where is the lease for the office, and have you read it? If you have to suddenly pay a month's rent for the office after his death, until things settle down, could you fork over the money? While it's true that the estate *should* cover things like this, courts often move too slowly for landlords, and you have to be prepared for the worst.

3w34im,cxtlbos,432parkavenue,"Hi there.
I can't speak to this too directly but I can explain my own families situation.
My grandfather was the owner/manager of a medium sized bank in West Germany after the war. It was run as a last-ditch attempt at a kind of wider community bank, instead of being on one side of the private/public scale it was arranged so the stakeholders (ie individuals who worked for, depended on the bank - as well as customers) comprised a sort of very large BoD.
So anyway, my family is large Prussian traditional/conservative ""old Europe"", it meant my grandfather was the head of the family, at least the direct family, and everyone depended on him.
Suddenly, when my own father was studying overseas, he died. My father wasn't told at all, he arrived back home a year or so later to find his dad was long buried and his assets carved up.
Furthermore the bank was obliterated by the various groups who wanted to expand it into a public bank or sell it for parts like some sort of knackered out car..
My father would have been prepared to drop his law career to set the families affairs in order and take on the responsibility of directing an institution upon which so many people depended. Unfortunately he never got that chance and today there's nothing left of that bank whatsoever.                                          
So perhaps I'm saying that you might regret letting it fall apart but equally I don't think I could have given up everything i had planned and worked for..
I work in higher finance and even now I don't think I could have taken in such a huge responsibility, especially at my age. About the same age as my dad was when he was faced with the same question.                      
In any case, I wish you all the best. Condolences of course but I don't doubt that explaining the choice to your own father will help him understand your point of view.

3w34im,cxtmjxp,cashcow1,"Accountant here. One of my former clients was a hotel chain. I'm also a real estate investor.

I would take a look at the company's financial statements. I would guess that this type of business has good profit margins, and fairly low overhead expenses. I would guess that the primary value in the company is the name (""You go to X company if you need to sell a hotel."") So, I am inclined to guess that the company's name is probably worth a good deal.

That said, selling hotels is fairly complicated. It's certainly not the most complicated business out there, but you have a lot of tax planning and compliance, contract drafting, negotiation, and you need a network (knowing who buys and sells hotels). 

Depending on how much of this work he was doing for his clients, you could consider bringing in a team to help you transition. Your administrative assistant and salesperson will help you with a lot of operations management. You will also want to consider bringing in an attorney and/or an accountant to consult on these deals so you don't mess something up (did Dad already do this?)

If you want to jump into this business, I would strongly recommend developing some expertise ASAP to help build your brand in the transition. Take classes or start reading books in areas like federal tax, business law (contracts, real property), and real estate finance.

The people who do best in the real estate business generally are experts in some area of it. Some are contractors that are very good at rehabbing properties and doing maintenance. Others are attorneys or accountants who understand the legal and financial subtleties in the business. Others are brokers or realtors who have an excellent understanding of the value of properties in their area, and find good deals.

If you can become eligible, it might be wise to become a CPA, CFA, or receive some other financial accreditation. Becoming a real estate agent isn't a bad idea, either. This will give you letters behind your name to let people know you are credible, and give you a lot of important knowledge for your business. You will learn about tax planning, finance, how to structure deals, etc.

Finally, start talking to Dad about the business, and start learning from the employees. Let him know you want to be involved.",ethical investing

3w34im,cxtwiha,ArchitectGeek,"I work for a real estate development firm that only operates in hospitality industry.  I also happen to be the only child in the family in the business and will be taking over in a few years.  While i can't speak directly to your line of business, I do know many hotel brokers both large and small, I know the ins/outs of the hospitality industry, and I know what it is like to try and work towards taking over a family business run by a patriarch.  A few comments for you in no particular order.

1. You are in no way going to be able to take over your Dad's business.  Don't waste your time trying.  

2. While I'm not an expert in business valuation I don't see very much value in your fathers company.  The best thing is to wind it down as painlessly as possible.

3. What you CAN do is talk to your Dad and start making contacts.  You will find the hotel business is one that is generally very friendly and people mostly want to see others do well.  Use your father's contacts for introductions and look for a good intro level job.  If your father has bought/sold many properties he probably has many owners/investors that have a great deal of respect for him.  I find it very likely that if you were to go ask them for a job using your father's goodwill you would end up in a great place.

4.  Use your name to your advantage.   I can say from experience having my ""last name"" in the hotel industry has been a boon for me.  Every time i walk around a conference I still hear ""hey your [ARCHITECTGEEK's] FATHERs"" Son!"" and I get about 15-20 minutes with a CEO that would normally not know or care who I was.  While generally being the boss' son can have downsides, being smart and using the upsides to your advantage is helpful.

5.  Given your fathers connection and your background in finance i would recommend taking a look at a financial analyst position with a hotel investment firm.  You spend a lot of time in the cube doing financial models, but after about 5-10 years you work your way up and hopefully get to bigger roles.

6.  Lastly, the hospitality industry is awesome.  So much cool stuff i get to do - ton's of travel (in fact I'm writing this from Honolulu as I am doing a construction review for a project) and we throw the best parties.  This is also a really great time for the industry right now so people are hiring.  Have him take you to a conference - attend all the networking events, go to the sessions you find industry and talk, talk, talk, talk.  The ALIS conference is one of the big ones and is coming up in early January.  If you Dad goes to that hopefully he can take you.

Happy to chat more if you would like any advise and while not stated above I am obviously vary sorry about your father.  I hope the opportunity to plan ahead of his passing is helpful to you both, personally and financially.  As a father of three young children I know i would do everything in my power to help them succeed both as a person and in their career.",ethical investing

3w34im,cxu0aa1,noclevername20,"Lots of great advice. My take: there are some businesses that are very wrapped up in the personality, trust relationships and contacts of the founder or key partners. He has only recently hired another salesman, so you can assume that these ""assets"" are not yet developed in the new guy. real estate is just one of those businesses, it takes 5-10 years to transfer those ""assets""to another key person. I have seen it in many small businesses in the service and sales area (small contracting firms (3-8 people)) real estate, creative services (small architects, lawyers, engineering firms), doctors offices.

Often the best plan is to arrange a purchase by another company when key players start considering retirement. Unfortunately, a buyer is going to recognize the value of the key players and see that value as greatly diminished if they cannot stay on to transfer these assets. 

What does your dad want? He may just want to make sure his clients and deals in progress are seen to conclusion, a different outcome than preserving the business. Think of it like a retiring doctor. He wants to make sure his patients find another good option. 

Sorry to give an overly negative response, If you can find someone else in the business local to your area (perhaps more than one) to evaluate the value of the client list and deals in progress, there may be something there. Talk to the contractor your dad hired. Is he very junior to your Dad? is he a trainee? or is he at your Dad's level? Is he already planning his next move? What is it? For all you know, he is already shopping the deals he is working with another firm (I have spent years working with sales a this level, assume that all commissioned salespeople are in self preservation mode).

260a0v,chmgpph,Cire11,"Also if you support a company by purchasing their shares in the secondary market (not from the company) you are promoting their stock price. This allows them to obtain future capital at a higher price because there is support for the higher stock price. If no one would buy their stock they would have to sell additional shares at a lower price meaning they have to issue a lot more shares to do so (thus diluting existing owners more). 

The ethics part of it isn't really too direct but you are indirectly promoting their future ability to obtain financing which is actually a really common thing. If you look at the number of shares outstanding on a 10K you will notice this number increase (and decrease sometimes).

260a0v,chmlkxj,mwk11,"Stanford University [recently announced](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/may/divest-coal-trustees-050714.html) they would divest from any coal companies in its $19 billion endowment.  This was driven by a student group, who wrote up [a report on the rationale and consequences of divestment](http://www.fossilfreestanford.org/report-the-case-for-divestment.html).  On p. 3, they offer two primary reasons for divestment:

1. It is unacceptable to profit from the destruction of our planet.

2. Divestment, as a strategy, can have a powerful social and political impact.

A few notes:

* As [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/260a0v/does_buying_a_stock_really_support_a_company_if_i/chmib1o) notes, if divestment makes a company's share price go down, other investors would see an increase in potential gains and therefore invest more money, until the price is close to its original value (to the extent that the [market is efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis)).  As a result, reason #2 intentionally avoids saying ""economic impact"" -- they point to studies that suggest the direct economic impact of the large-scale divestment of South African companies during apartheid was minimal (but they claim it had social/political impact by sparking an anti-apartheid movement).

* OP asked ""Does buying a stock really support a company? What gain does the company get?""  While it would be unacceptable to support a company whose business is deemed immoral, due to my first note that share price may not be affected much, divestment moreso prevents the investor from profiting from immoral activity (reason #1).  There is the sense of weakening social/political support -- another example is the tobacco industry.  ""The stigmatization of the industry brought by divestment made it easier for policymakers to regulate and tax tobacco."" (p. 8)

* You might think the opposite strategy of buying a large percent of a company may work by gaining control and steering it in a more ethical direction.  ""Strategies like proxy voting and shareholder resolutions are important tools when seeking to improve the operating practices of a company, but are of little use when the underlying business model is itself the problem. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows corporations to disregard resolutions that relate to 'ordinary business operations.' This rule would invalidate most resolutions that demand fundamental changes to a company’s business model."" (p. 8)

* Divestment may not reduce the investor's bottom line, although there is disagreement.  A ""22 year analysis by Advisor Partners found that the 'simulated performance of [a] full divestment portfolio was virtually indistinguishable from that of the S&P 500 index.' "" (p. 9)  Burton Malkiel argues that a portfolio more than 20 individual stocks sees little to no reduction in risk from further diversification, although [William Bernstein](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm) argues for total diversification because a few outlier ""superstocks"" may drive total market return.

* Divestment may actually lead to long-term gains, if your reasons for divestment are strong enough.  ""The international community has agreed upon a limit of 2°C of warming. To avoid surpassing this limit, we must keep four-fifths of proven fossil fuel reserves in the ground. The implication of these numbers is that our financial markets are carrying a massive 'carbon bubble.' We are pricing fossil fuel companies based on unburnable reserves, and are 'fail[ing] to properly account for the risks inherent in owning carbon-intensive assets.'

Or, that GE stock could be more like a commodity, where the investors with the highest expectation of future earnings value and growth drive up the price. 

If stock is like a $100 bill, ethical investment choices wouldn't have an impact, but if demand affected price, ethical choices would, in the form of the company's ability to raise future capital.

Worked retail in college, then retail and line cook, then line cook and IT intern, then Programmer and line cook, then just Programmer.

Sometimes I hear people talk about their college life and I have a moment of feeling like I missed out. But I also know that if I didn't work in college and graduated with $60,000 more in debt, I would have regretted that even more.

When my bf first moved in with me (about 3 months into dating) he burned through his savings, and I had to cover him for about $4k.

aqzbpx,egljd4u,UnrelentingCuriosity,"Let's focus on minimizing the amount of loaned money involved. 
First, the stock market in the short-term is similar to gambling and there is an entire industry devoted to that kind of trading. Unless you can invest a sum for years, you cannot invest more than you can afford to lose. Lines of credit should never be taken out exclusively to keep more money in the market.
So as for as earning money, you should be able to sell your blood plasma for a sum of money. Other than that two weeks is a tight time frame so if you have unnecessary belongings of value, consider selling them. 
You don't actually tell us how much money a month's worth of pay is and how quickly you could pay your girlfriend back. Can you afford to pay back $100 a paycheck? $50. The time frame for paying her back is important. 
>To be clear I am a frugal person and don't have anything to hide, I just like my privacy and ability to live life without someone looking over my shoulder.

The loan appears to be a good option and I would recommend it if you hadn't made the statement above. You appear to be worried about her having input in how you control your finances but a couple (long-term) should be comfortable talking about and discussing money. 
So,
I would sell blood plasma and unnecessary items.
I would take advantage of local food providers for those in need. (IE, local campus churches may offer free food each week)
I would take the loan, cover my immediate debts. 
I would begin advertising myself as a tutor to pull in extra money every week. 
I would reach payday and payback whatever possible.
I would continue this process until she is paid back in full including selling the blood plasma and tutoring to supplement your income.
I would consider continuing this process until I had an emergency fund of $1000 dollars to avoid this situation in the future.

From reading your other replies I understand you see this income as a type of curse and to a degree I suppose I understand though I can't relate given I don't have your persepective. Assuming you understand the basics of investment and maintaining that wealth, really it just comes down to not getting shafted on the taxes which is best handled by a professional, and making this money work for you in a way that you'll never want for anything best handled by proper investments. Assuming you are past all that. I suggest living as anonymously wealthy as you can, being careful who you help and don't help, not letting anyone know who you are wealth wise if you can and if you are truly uncomfortable with the type of wealth you have accumulated consider what options you can and the types of people you want to help and help them. Money is easily lost if it is not protected no matter how large the amount so helping people in a careful/safe pace is heavily recommended. If you're beyond that point then I can only say that I'm sorry you feel conflicting emotions about your wealth and I hope you move forward and use those emotions to build a better world for those who also would try to make the world a better place.

That number kind of stuck with me for a long time, and when I got my first engineering job I was very excited to recieve am ""enormous"" starting salary of about 60K. 

Let me tell you what 60K is like in these parts: you get $3400/mo to take home. $500 either goes to loans or savings depending on your personal situation. A crappy apartment is 1k but you figure you've worked hard so you deserve to drop $1400 on a nicer place to live. You buy a moderately priced car and pay $400/mo payments plus $100 for insurance. A few hundred for groceries and then utilities, phone, eat out a few times, and you are broke. Not bad, but not exactly the lavish life I used to expect even 50K would bring you. 

My point is, throughout the US and Canada at least, baller lifestyles cost six figures in 2017.

>What type of career do you pursue and what is your expected income?

Engineering. After five years, I wasn't making much. But I'm doing much better now. My goal is somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000.

>What sort of housing do you live in?

In the Navy, housing, while crappy, is free. In college, I lived in a cheap downtown apartment.

>What are your thrifty money saving tactics?

Live cheap. Buy used. Live below the standard your parents raised you under. Don't waste money partying. Alcohol is expensive. Books are not.

>What do you do, if anything, with the money that you make to make it grow?

Find a good money market. Invest some in no-load mutual funds.

>If credit comes into play, how do you establish that credit?

I don't care about establishing a credit score. With sufficient income and assets, you can get a loan if you need one, but the only loan I ever needed was a mortgage.

>Do you opt to spend any time going to school/ learning a trade or do you head straight to work?

I learned a trade in the Navy, so I went right to work.

**Month 1:** Get a nurses assistant job at a nursing home. This is a highly undesirable job but it pays OK and it's in demand. There is a CNA/First Aide requirement but many companies need people so badly they will hire you on the spot and assist you in getting it.

$9 an hour, with about 10 hours of overtime a week (cause you volunteer to cover for the aides who are suffering burnout.)

I picked Arizona because walking/bicycling/public transit is practical all year round, and it has a huge retirement population. Also, because it is a retail-driven economy, it wasn't hugely affected by the 2008 crash.

We're now pulling in $1824.48 per month after taxes. Less food, public transit, and new scrubs ($290): **$1534.48**

**Month 2**: Emptying bedpans and showering old people who try to smear their feces on you motivates you to open that overpriced MacBook that you convinced your now-estranged parents to get you. You sign up for Coursera and CodeAcademy and start taking web programming classes.

For the month, $1224.48  
Net Savings: **$8416.88**

**1 Year**: For lasting a year with the company you become a *senior* employee. You get a $1 raise, but there's a catch: you have to work at a facility just outside of town, not on a bus route. So you purchase a boring but practical car *with working AC* for $3,000. Taxes + registration comes out to about $300. 

In a twist of events, your roommate gets a significant other who moves in with you. They decide to split the rent 33% each way, so your rent is now $200. It's a little harder to sleep though. The overtime hours are hard, but you are sticking it out for now.

You have completed numerous courses online and have exhausted other training materials. With a fair grasp on the topic you now start building sample applications from scratch in order to build a programming portfolio.

But everything is in motion. Your roommates are not renewing their lease on the apartment. You managed to interest an obscure web services company to hire you as a Jr. Programmer for $15 an hour. Pittance by programmer standards but great for you because it is your entry into your target industry. Plus you yourself are facing real burnout at the nursing home.

You move into a new, slightly nicer apartment with your girlfriend. Your share in the housing expenses is $500. You also decided to feed yourself a little better. Your mutual Fund A performed at 6%, and Fund B performed at 9%. You stock two more funds so that you have mutual fund diversity.

I will start off with a full time job in retail at $20/hour. Slaving for 8 hours a day, 7 days a week = $1120/week. With ~$220/week spending on necessity gives me $900/week surplus. 3 months that will give me $10,000.

By 3rd month, Moving out to establish rent @ $150/week + food @ 220/week, gives me a surplus of $750. **Savings = $10,000**

By 6th month, rent + food + phone/internet @ 80 = $450. Surplus ~$670/week. **Savings is now = $18,040.**

By 1st year, rent + food + phone/internet = 450. Surplus $670/week. Savings = $34,120. Buy a used car @ $5,000. Savings is now **$29,120.**

Now I will enroll myself into university for Bachelor of Oil and Gas Engineering, aiming to graduate with honours. Work will now cut down from $1120/week to $320/week (working weekends only). Running at a deficit of -$130/week. Using Australian Government's HECS-HELP scheme, I dont pay a cent until I start working. So **cost of education = $0.**

Deficit of -$130/week will eat through my savings for 4 years ($130 x 52 weeks x 4 years) = $27,040. Savings is now **$2,080.**

Start work with oil and gas company. With my female minority ethnicity, employment rate is 100%. I will start off with $100,000 salary.

So wealth in 5 years, = $2000. With higher education.

Give me another 5 years = $500k savings. Minus $30k from university fees, **savings is now $470k in 10 years.**

--

EDIT: For the people asking about taxes. This event is extremely hypothetical. The goal is to maximize your wealth so I'm assuming 100% savings rate, tax and yearly income remuneration cancels out.

Or I can just move to Brunei or Qatar, where the tax is 0% and oil rigs are plenty.

1342u4,c70ucx9,,"I'd move to North Dakota and work on the natural gas rigs up there.  I'd go to community college and get a 3 month certificate in welding.  My jobs on the rigs would be maximized to network wherever I can.  I'd take whatever student loans I could get, since you've required that I get my own place in 3 months and that initial transition to full time work might be difficult.  

After I get the certification, I'd get an older, cheap crossover or minivan with good gas mileage and welding equipment.  I'd find a job welding on the rigs and during my off time do contract work under my own name.  The van and equipment would be a business expense which would help with taxes.  As business and experience grows, I'd swap over to the business.  I'd also start a solo 401K which would allow me to contribute $50K per year before taxes.

The housing situation would be a shared house or apartment with other working types.  I'd probably rent a crappy apartment and then sublet the rooms on a month to month basis to workers that are in town on a more temporary basis.  A little risky, but renting it monthly and by room (or half room) should command a premium and help cover my rent.  Food would pretty much be what it is now.. heavy on vegetables, lean protein and whole grains that are prepared with an eye towards cost savings.  I'm not willing to sacrifice health for savings.

Investments would be short to mid term corporate bonds with a small amount (maybe 20%) of stocks.  Over a 5 year time period, I wouldn't want to take a gamble on the stock market being higher.

So with $70K or so being the starting salary for an unskilled rig worker, I figure I'd close out $70K the first year, $100K the second, and $130K for the third to fifth years where I ran a business.  It's tough to estimate how much exactly could be made out of a theoretical business, but it's easy to assume that if it wasn't beating a salaried position, I'd stay salaried.

With expenses at $20K per year, that would be $520K saved ignoring taxes.  I'd put a more realistic number at $350K-$400K in mostly tax-deferred accounts.",ethical investing

At my friend's house I will search for jobs that do not require a lot of training or where they give their own training. such as: Mcdonald's, warehouse moving boxes, fedex. The type of work for which I do not need a lot of brain.

Month 2 and 3: I keep all the money that I got for home deposit

Month 4:
I search for a rental room that is not far from where I work or near a subway.
 I prepare envelops each written a fair amount of money for my monthly budget, so I do not spend all my money on things that I do not need.
Envelope 1: Groceries
Envelope 2: transport
Envelope 3: a small amount for my own entertainment (cinema/cofee ..)
Envelope 4: car purchase deposit will not touched in 8 months
Envelope 5: cell phone deposit will not be touched in 2 months


During my job I socialize with colleges and upper management to get most information about how they work and how they organized, and listen to their advices. I will emulate what my collegues who have more experience do.

Socializing with the rest is very important because at this stage I do not want to be hurt or fired because of some stupid guy. I want everybody to say he is a good guy we want to keep him.

Month 5: 
I will look for jobs that are in higher position that will require some of the knowledge that I got from the basic job that I have. I will try to get most information from my boss about how is doing his job.

Month 6: apply for jobs that are not on the same company but for higher salary. So if I was flipping burger in MCdonalds I will to burger king to manage a shop.

Buy cell phone and contract of phone and internet. I have already my envelopes full of money.

Month 7: change of job increase salary, put the difference on car .
Month 12: buy a car, a small one from the 80's that is very simple with just the minimum.


Note: The most important part of all this plan is socializing and making friends with coworker and bosses. they will tell you every little secret of the business and will help you improve.

Also I have not taken into account that I can help my friend from the first 3 months and pay him for my couch and be a nice person to him. then I might even stay for longer. Let's say I pay him the cost of the couch and make his dishes and dinner. why would he kick me out?

c3dat3,erqy99o,socialistchangenow,"The alternative to both fossil fuels and nuclear energy is a combination of energy efficiency and renewables which in various ways harnesses the plentiful and free energy from the sun, the tides and the earth to produce electricity, direct heating and provide fuel. Given the choice of fossil fuels that are ruining our planet and cause pollution and climate change, and nuclear which is short term, causes climate change and produces highly toxic waste, or using renewables which are free, do not cause climate change or significant pollution, it would seem there is no contest. Yet internationally there is a serious move to destroy renewable energy. Capitalist Governments continue to highly subsidize fossil fuels and nuclear power, and they and Capitalist business continue to spend much less on research and investment into renewables.

Capitalist companies that are based on fossil fuels and nuclear are very big business. Oil and gas, auto, road construction, airlines, property developers and the power supply companies are among the giants of the Capitalistic world. A shift to a high-energy, high-efficiency Socialist society, with well insulated buildings, a move away from horrible urban sprawl, and a dramatic shift to public and energy efficient transport would damage many of these Capitalist companies. In addition, the supply of renewable energy challenges the power structures of the almost imperialist corporations. Fossil fuels are found in large amounts in relatively few places in the world. Energy is supplied in long supply lines from centralized sources to the users. Energy flows one way and money the other, with the capitalist companies in control.

Renewable energy sources, in contrast, are available almost everywhere on the planet. In a renewable energy Socialist society, production would include many small sources with households being both suppliers and consumers. These two features would threaten many of the capitalist energy corporations. Renewables could meet all of the earth’s energy needs. However, Capitalist economics and politics of energy mean that, in the short term, big business and their pet governments are not seriously going to shift to them.

It is likely that in the short term capitalism will go for nuclear and coal in response to peak oil and leave the increased problems to future generations. If there is not a fundamental shift to Socialist efficiency and renewables there is a risk of serious energy shortages and energy wars, with the living standards of the workers in the advanced capitalist countries facing an additional and fundamental threat.

In theory, capitalism is capable of moving to renewable energy, but there are many barriers due to its priorities and structures, and it is leaving it late. The clocks of both climate change and peak oil are ticking away. Environmental problems, once considered small and local issues, now pose fundamental challenges not just to capitalism but to humanity’s future development. If capitalism does not solve the energy issues and there is a major collapse in energy supply before capitalism is overthrown then human society could be thrown backwards. Again, the future is a choice between Socialism and barbarism. Without Socialist change we could see the destruction of the planet and Human society without any ability to recover.",ethical investing

In particular Joe Higgins, Socialist MEP (Member of the European Parliament) has based his campaign on presenting the contents of the treaty and his interpretation of its consequences for workers rights, European Democracy, Common defense and foreign policy. 

For the most part the Yes campaign - in particular the Mainstream political parties and 'civil groups' such as 'We Belong', 'Ireland for Europe' and 'generation yes' (all with connections to mainstream political parties or in the case of generation yes the Irish Business and Employers confederation) have funneled millions of Euros (even Intel have gotten in on the act) into cynically manipulating public opinion on the treaty by representing it as critical to Ireland's economic recovery - e.g. 'For Jobs, Vote Yes', 'For Recovery, vote yes' and 'Recovery or Ruin, vote yes'. 

I have a strong feeling that the treaty will be ratified because the Irish electorate have been duped into believing that the Treaty represents some kind of economic cure-all and it will place us 'at the heart of Europe', whatever that means? Not to mention how undemocratic it is to hold a SECOND referendum on the same issue. I'm really ashamed to be Irish this week and this whole process has really broken my heart politically.

> It is quite disheartening.

> I can forgive the media to some extent, since they will always find a simple story more newsworthy than a nuanced one. And unfortunately the arguments against the Lisbon Treaty are just that; nuanced. Arguments for the Yes side tend to be relatively simple: jobs, economics, cultural engagement with Europe. Arguments against are quite complicated: 'corporate interests will trump the rights of citizens, privatisation of social services will go ahead', 'the EU is not a very democratic institution, laws can't even be proposed by MEPs only amended' etc.

> This is probably why the No campaign has made such amazingly stupid errors. The coir campaign of voting no because the minimum wage would be reduced to 1.85? Why name an amount?, the point is well made without an actual figure that you would then have to justify. They must have just pulled it out of the air, it is amateurish in the extreme and probably caused the No campaign quite a bit of damage.

> The funny thing is, there is an honest, articulate and highly respected politician on the No side that could have engendered a real debate, and not just 'euthanasia will be mandatory' screaming paraniod talking points. I am of course talking about Joe Higgins. I was rather looking forward to the fact that since Declan Ganley was run out of Ireland, the obvious choice to be at the head of the No campaign was Joe Higgins, who, to be fair, has had a higher profile than the last campaign. But then, as if mocked by cruel fate, Declan (Fucking) Ganley arrives back on the scene and spends the rest of the campaign talking about whether he gets donations from US armaments manufacturers or london hedge funds.

> It's almost like he is an agent provocateur, I mean what kind of ego must the man have to think that after his embarrasing failure to get elected (and then embarrasing toys-out-of-pram throwing after learning of this) that he would have had anything but a negative effect on the campaign.

> To finish: an argument rarely made for voting no.

> I am pro-european but I will vote no (more nuance). Why? Because this is fundamentally a bad deal for the people of Europe. We are taking a system built by accident as much as design, without a proper framework of checks and balances and turning it into a de facto federal power.

> If I was asked honestly if I wanted a federal europe I would probably say yes (it is inevitable anyway, right?), but with a political system/framework capable of providing this in an equitable way to all its citizens. I suspect most people feel the same but they are making a huge leap of faith to think the Lisbon Treaty is it.

> We need to establish a european political system that is right at the start. After all, it is very hard to change it once it is written into law (look at the voting system in England: think the Lib Dems would really change it to PR if they got in? I certainly doubt it). I happen to think the Irish system is one of the more equitable in the world. There are things I would change, but I think it is a reasonably good system. We are about to swap it for a system that can and will be manipulated by special interests to the detriment of the majority of its citizenry.

>
> In September 2008 the Czech President stated that he would not sign the treaty until Ireland had ratified it. Prior to that he had stated that he was awaiting the verdict of the Constitutional Court concerning a complaint submitted by senators against certain parts of the treaty. The Court dismissed this complaint on 26 November 2008. However, the senators have since asked the Constitutional Court to assess the treaty as a whole. On 29 September 2009 a group of Czech senators lodged a fresh complain with the Constitution court. It is not known how long it will take the court to give its verdict. Anaylsts have stated the case could take up to six months to be resolved. In which case it could move close to the general election in the UK, which polls show the Conservatives are on course to win. The Conservatives have said they will put the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum if it has not been ratified by all members at their time of election

Either way, using donor funds to invest in them shows that you're being ethically responsible - and that's crucial. Donations sitting in a bank account doing nothing - that can be bad.

I don't have direct proof, but it's very unlikely. Hundreds of finance professors and thousands of professional investors look for investing strategies that get good returns, and once they become commonly known they stop working as well. If bad actors had better than market risk-adjusted returns the prices would go up until that effect disappeared. 

In general I would think ""Do no harm"" funds would do about as well as similar mutual funds, and their apparent underperformance could just be the result of a short history and bad luck. It's possible that they won't attract top talent, or that their restrictions will cost them some profit, but I would think these effects would be fairly small.

wf8wr,c5cuht2,i-cjw,"""The whole benefit to an index fund is that a monkey can run it""

""Set up the fund as a normal index fund, spreading risk around by just buying the whole market""

Oh dear. Someone has looked at the fee structure for passive investments, and made the huge leap that cheap = easy. It's not. There's a reason why passive is dominated by large, well capitalized groups like BGI and State Street. Passive is cheap because it has to be - if you charged active fees, then the underperformance would be unacceptable. The only way to keep fees down is to run enormous AUM.

As for painting passive as a ""monkey"" strategy, the author might like to consider why passive funds spend large amount of money to employ some of the best quant teams on the street. It's just not as simple as ""just buying the index"" - optimising trading, dealing with inclusion/deletion issues, finessing liquidity. These things require enormous intellectual and infrastructure firepower to get right.

The author also approaches risk with all the precision of a Chinese chef hacking up a chicken. As companies get ""voted out"" of the list of candidates, what's the proposal for reweighting? What's the proposal for dealing with the factor biases vs the market portfolio, and how is tracking error going to be monitored and controlled? And how is all this integrated to optimize and minimize trading costs and frictions?

Look, it's a cute idea and it has that oh-so-popular ""crowd sourcing"" tag. The jury is still out on ethical investing - studies variously show worse returns, same returns, better returns, lower volatility, higher volatility to regular index funds (although, and this is important, consistently higher tracking errors). But really, the least of your worries is how you figure out which companies are good and bad - they key is to avoid absolutely decimating your returns through poor execution and ill-considered portfolio construction. And I see neither of those issues addressed here.",ethical investing

So then you have to compare that marginal cost (bad company getting a little bit of your money) to the cost of putting your money into a (theoretically) suboptimal portfolio. My guess is that unless you have tons of money (in which case you can afford top active managers) the evil company won't be at all affected by your choices. So this whole thing is moot on a personal level. 

That said, I get why google might care, and I've seen protests over ethical investing occur on college campuses. Large endowment funds actually can have an impact. I'd say rather than crowd source ethical investing, the best way to achieve that end would be to pressure socially minded bodies like college endowment funds into shifting money away from ""unethical"" companies.

If it is trading they wont care about these qualifications at all, 'business' qualifications are poorly regarded on most desks, well certainly the ones i have worked on. People who work in hedge funds or in the front office of a bank are all very intelligent and most consider the difference between someone who has the qualifications and someone who doesn't is just time. It isn't considered difficult and hence carries little weight. It is certainly not a badge of honour by any means. Places are increasingly getting tired of resumes that are littered with qualifications, they are becoming all too common. It is classic story:

* Apply for jobs
* Fail to get in.
* Go back to school to get more qualified.
* And repeat.

The reality is that the vast majority of things you learn will be done on the job and will probably bare very little if any resemblance to what you have learnt in a CFA or similar. If you want to impress a hedge fund you aren't going to do it with qualifications. Go out and do something ballsy like starting your own business or gold mining, whatever. It really doesn't matter. 

Just bare in mind with qualifications how many people get them each year and how many jobs there are in hedge funds. The qualifications may help you have better understand of the larger picture of finance but they certainly won't give you an edge over anyone else, you are better off spending your time doing something else that will make you stand out. In the end all that matters is standing out.

CFA, like most American qualifications, is meant to be a top up, and INCREDIBLE top-up... but a top up nevertheless, they require you to develop, by your own self, a good base for it (a pedestal for your trophy, as it were). You want to follow that route, get a GOOD degree first, then crown it with a CFA. Even if the requirements don't require it *per se* , it's assumed to be a given. People will ask for your college (not that I think it will matter much, but they will *ask*) in addition to your CFA.

ACA, meanwhile, is a British qualification, and they, unlike CPA etc, are meant to nab you right out of high school. Oh sure college options exist, but they are structured to capture you early on.

NO ONE asks an ACA if they ever went to college or whatever.... college is merely another plus, heck I am sure you can get a college degree on the basis of your ACA papers plus some minor project. Colleges love to offer ACA bachelor degrees (or exemptions) in order to nab them for masters (usually an MBA top-up)

Not to mention the difference in scope etc...

So your *actual* option is:

* ACA outright

* GOOD college degree + CFA.

Not a bad thing, isn't? :D My views on Islamic banking mostly shaped by ""Malaysian style"" of Islamic banking. I am not sure about the ""middle east"" style of Islamic banking.


1. 
Some of ""ustaz"" said that current system should not be consider as ""Islamic banking"". Islamic banking do not mix with conventional banking system. why? because they believes that Islamic banking should be based on ""dinar and dirham""(gold and silver) value. Their argument based on some hadith, and they use some ""mathematical equation"" to show that a sheep value in Rasulullah SAW era is the same value right now, based on the value of dinar.

There is also some disagreement about Sukuk. Few years ago, there was a company that had some problems with their sukuk and their sukuk was almost defaulted. (I forgot the company's name). If, Islamic banking is mostly about profit sharing, this should not happen.

Like loveIsHappiness said, the current Islamic Banking is just a conventional bank using Islam as a disguise. It is just a workaround for interest based banking system. 

2. 
Like a VC. Most Islamic banking should work as a VC. It is actually quite complicated. In Islamic banking in it's purest form, where interest does not exist, you actually investing you money by setting up new businesses. Like a VC. If you compare Islamic banking in its purest form and current conventional bank, conventional bank actually similar to ""Bayt al-mal"" and NOT the current Islamic banking system. How Muslim should handle their savings? By investing it into new businesses. So, actually, there are no ""banks"" in Islam, just VC. So, Islamic banks right now, should act like a VC.

3. 
Although Islamic banks do not pay out interest, the service charge in some of Islamic banks in Malaysia is outrageous. Because they cannot charge interest to their customers, they have to charge additional service charge which sometimes exceed the normal interest charge by conventional banks with the same value of loans.

4. 
It depends. If Islamic banking is the only banks in Greece, it will go bust straight away. Why? because Islamic banking depends on the society to make good business decision. The bank investment depends on the business/company's health. Any profit or loss, will be shared equally. So, if the bank's investment go bad, go figure it out. If the bank does not do anything with their money, their money value will be eroded by inflation. That is why Islamic banking only works in ""gold standard"" environment.

5. 
Ethical way? Islamic banking can be greedy too. lol Just look at the advising fees for some ulama' in Islamic banking. I used to think all ulama' should live like Nik Aziz of Kelantan and giving out their expertise with minimum fees for the sake of the ummah. In Islamic banking, there are "" Greedy Superstars"" too. lol

2-The profit and loss sharing part is very nice, but only if they actually shared a loss. They don't, and it's not because they are run perfectly, it's because they run using the old system, which ensure they don't have a *loss* ( it's anecdotal evidence,  but given that this is from my bro's friends, it's still worth considering.)

There was a religious scholar on TV, exalting the virtues of Islamic banking, and he said that if you, say, total your leased car, the bank doesn't force you to cough up the rest, and *shares* the loss instead. I am not sure how it works, or whether it exists at all.

3-My insider info is that the *fluctuations* in profit rates, which are supposedly reflecting the variations in actual real-time profits, is just a covered up LIBOR+% floating interest rate.

4-Unfortunately, since the Islamic banks here are apparently not interest-free at all, I am not sure how that reflects in our society.

5-The problem is, Islamic is not just about profit-&-loss sharing, it's also about stuff like forgiving loans of those who can't repay them, or at least giving them as much time as you can. Individual agree on a personal basis how much they are willing to delay or forgive, banks don't have the luxury.
(as I said, in point 2, banks don't actually share loss, or every one would withdraw their money)

This reminds me of a documentary done by a European team (Norwegian NGO, I think) regarding Grameen Bank. As you might remember, the owner got a Nobel prize for championing the cause of micro finance, often amounts as low as $10.

The Documentary showed the obverse side, when *many* debtors failed to repay even such tiny amounts. Grameen was a conventional bank, and it sent out the leg-breakers, which made the defaulters life hell. 

My point is, if Grameen was an *ethical* Islamic bank, it would supposedly be unable to send debt-collectors to force people to cough up, and if you start forgiving those $10 defaulters, the whole system would flop.

Fact is, the whole *Profit and Loss Sharing Banks* terminology is an oxymoron, since people put money in a bank to be SECURE, and Loss doesn't figure in it.

Still, here are a few ideas you can think about:

- you might believe that some forms of income are more virtuous than others, for instance if you think labor income is ""better"" than capital income (which is a form of rent), then you might want to redistribute some of the capital income to the labor income

- since wealth tends to concentrate, you might want to dampen that effect with wealth taxes, to reduce inter-generational wealth and fight inequality, so that it's easier for low-income people to climb the social ladder

- you can think that in a just world, the only inequalities that are justified are the ones that would make everyone worse off if they didn't exist. If everyone was perfectly equal, there wouldn't be any incentive to work, but you don't necessarily need huge amounts of inequality for there to be enough incentives to work.

- there is also an argument to be made about the marginal decreasing utility of money. Since your marginal income when you're already rich is worth way less than your marginal income when you're poor, you could argue that it just makes sense to raise revenue from people who will be less hurt by that income capture.

- taxing the rich can also be a way to counteract the effects of market power. Since the rich tend to get most of their revenue from capital income, it is likely that they capture rents from the monopsony power  they have as capital owners on the labor market. Progressive taxes can be a way to redistribute these rents to the workers that produced the value they captured.

- inequality tends to reduce growth, so it's better for the economy as a whole if some policies mitigate inequality some way or another.

When thinking about policy changes an important tools is ceteris paribus: all else equal. By lumping this together with min-wage hikes and tax-cuts you are distorting your view of  the effects this would have. If forced substitution of wages for equity has merit then it should have merit without being lumped together with other policies. This will help you think about other policy-changes in future. 

/u/zzzzz94 is right in all his criticisms. I would like to point out another one: for the firm, where are these stocks coming from? Buy-backs? Fresh emissions?
If emissions are used, without anyone actually paying for the stocks, then the value of each share is diluted as the total equity of the firm is fixed but the number of shares increases. This brings the value of existing stocks down, not a nice situation for the poor person who was just payed in that stock.

You should also consider that stocks are risky, what happens to people who receive 25% of their pay in stocks when the next financial crash hits? They will be extremely hard-hit. More risk-exposure yields chance of high returns but also of large losses. This brings me to:

"" I do feel, however, that people will hold on to this stock without being told to due to simple human psychology - we hate loss and don't want to give up what we already have.""

This is probably true and is an argument against your forced stock ownership, even if everyone can sell their stock for cash or a diversified portfolio the people who actually do so will be of a certain type, probably higher earners. The people who stick with their single-stock suboptimal portfolio are likely to be people who are low-earners to begin with. 


If you really think that financial assets are the best way for poor people to get richer then why not give tax-breaks to low-income households that hold stocks?

Specifically, the financial system may not set interest rates so that a decrease in household saving results in an equal increase in investment. This is the basic Keynesian justification for modern central banking.

However, at the extreme, there may be no interest rate low enough to convince firms to engage in enough investment to cause all markets to clear and the full employment of capital and labour. (Keynes called this the liquidity trap). This is the Keynesian justification for counter-cyclical fiscal policy.

Now, in some ways 80 years of economic thought have not been kind to some of Keynes' reasoning. Modern dynamic macro has blunted many of the simpler models built from Keynes' ideas and some of his policy prescriptions are widely viewed as somewhat unwise (although there's a never-ending battle over exactly what Keynes meant given that he died before the broad implementation of Keynesian macro policy)

But those two basic propositions survive amongst most economists. All undergrads are taught them, modern monetary policy is predicated on the first, and most governments responded to the GFC consistently with the second.

The General Theory is hard to read because it comes from the period of economic theory before mathematical modelling and argument took over. Trying to read anything from that era and before is often difficult because it's all built on each other and it's all built on what we'd call ""implicit modelling"" now.

But your conclusion of the impact of the book is probably not correct. Keynes persuasively and seemingly correctly diagnosed the basic causes of the business cycle. It's complicated because economics is complicated and he was trying to reform most of it at once.

5nlco5,dcchamj,MrDannyOcean,"If you make it less lucrative to be a landlord, fewer people will be landlords.  People respond to incentives.  The amount of housing units available to rent will plummet, and I doubt the general public will be much better off.  Long term, it seems likely people would build fewer housing units because it's less profitable to do so, and the decrease in supply would cause prices to go up and quality to go down.

> but also a monthly profit for doing nothing to very little. 

I don't think we have the same definition of 'nothing to very little'.  Being a landlord is a massive PITA much of the time.  I have family members who rent out homes and they're ready to quit after a few years of 

* maintenance, constantly.  Owning a house is not a low-time-investment opportunity.
* chasing down rent from deadbeats who never pay on time, who already have all kinds of legal protections
* cleaning out horrific messes (think shit smeared into the carpets) from previous tenants, so they can attempt to rent a clean house to the next tenant (and they didn't get back almost any of the 10K they had to spend de-shitting the carpets, sadly)

Being a landlord does involve actual work.

>what I fear is a middle-class attitude that if you've saved (or, sadly, often just been given) a deposit to buy a second property you're just entitled and somehow deserving of the benefits and the extra monthly pocket money

This is a personal opinion, but what a weird attitude.  If you've saved your money...  how dare you buy something with it, and how dare you expect to have control over the thing you bought with your own money? If you saved, how dare you buy an asset and get benefits from it? That's just a strange way to look at the world.",ethical investing
5nlco5,dccii4z,shady_mcgee,"> 1) Prevent landlords from charging more than the mortgage

We don't need the government for this.  This is largely what happens in practice thanks to market forces.  When it comes down to it, once you add in the cost of maintenance ($2-4k/yr) and vacancy (the landlord still needs to pay the mortgage if the house is vacant, which will be 5-10% of the time) there's not a whole lot of room for profit.  I can run some scenarios using currently on-the-market properties in the DC region where I live if you're interested, but it's very difficult to find properties that are cash-flow positive once you account for maintenance and vacancy.  In the best-case scenario you might be making $100/mo on a $20k+ investment which is worse than you can get in the stock market. Most of the true profit happens if you're able to buy a property at a significant discount to market price, or due to appreciation when you sell.

> but also a monthly profit for doing nothing to very little. 

I think you under estimate the amount of work a landlord does.  When the property is vacant they need to meet potential tenants, run background checks, deliver the lease and keys.  

If they get a bad tenant and need to evict they could be tied up in court for months (without getting paid by the tenant but having to pay their lawyers and court fees to run the eviction).

When the tenant leaves they need to clean the unit and perform any simple maintenance items (paint and carpets need to be re-done frequently)

Finally, they need to be on-call 24/7 in case something goes wrong in the apartment (or pay someone else to do so, in which case all profit is going to the property manager, which at least in the US typically take the first months rent and then 10% of all subsequent rent).  

Even in the 'best case' scenario your landlord is doing all of this for around 1200/yr.


> However, the current system and inflation of house prices here just IS NOT sustainable

You're probably only looking at the *price* of housing and not the total *cost* of housing.  Since most housing is financed the nominal price is only one factor.  Another big factor is interest rates, which are currently at generational lows.  I don't have any numbers for the UK, but I do have 40 years of history for the US, and it paints a surprising picture.

On the whole housing is cheaper now than almost any time in the past 40 years.  As I said, I don't have the UK numbers, but interest rates there have followed a similar trend as in the US, and interest rates are by far the biggest factor of home affordability.  When you look around and say 'Housing is expensive' you need to realize that housing has ***always*** been expensive.  It's not a new phenomenon and it may not even be as expensive as it was in the past.  At current rates housing would need to nearly double in price to reach the same % of income : payment ratio we saw in the early 80s (and looking at the BoE rate history I see 15-16% rates in the early 80s for England, too).",ethical investing

The landlord also needs an incentive to maintain the property and try to make it better. He may consider it worth his time to lobby the local government to improve the area, or consider building a larger building with more units.  Any time you reduce the profit incentive you create problems.

Some cities, especially beachfront communities,  already have laws in place to induce landlords to rent out their apartments.

* Further, the theory doesn't relate to multiplying by a magic number, it relates to the total increase in national income as a result of an increase in government spending. Your spending is my income. If the government hires you to build a hospital, and pay you X, you will spend bX on goods and services, resulting in income increasing by X and bX, then, those who received bX may spend abX, and those who receive abX have their incomes increased by that amount. This follows on to create the multiplier, so that a $1 increase in government spending may not result in a $1 increase in national income.

The complaint also states that Nunes had invested in Alpha & Omega’s sister winery, Phase 2 Cellars, in 2015. Nunes’s investment reportedly amounted to between $50,001 and $100,000, despite the winery requiring that shareholders make a minimum investment of $200,000.

No one could possibly accuse of him of having 'gross negligence' where classified material are concerned, now could they? Well, maybe one guy would.

>FBI Director James Comey, who oversaw both the Petraeus and Clinton investigations, disagreed.

While I am totally on board with retiring Don Young, for so many reasons, I would NEVER vote for someone to represent this great, unique and special state to someone who hasn't lived here.

I think that your interest, ideas and energy would be better spent, either running to represent YOUR state, or....maybe move to Alaska, spend some time, get to know our needs, our struggles, our exceptionally unique place in the U.S. and maybe run to represent us 5-10 years down the road. 

What I fear, you will, and hope you won't do, is get enough votes from Democrats and reasonable Independents to allow Don Young to win again. This is Alaska, people here consider those not born and raised  here to be suspect. You won't win. If you care about Alaska (and why would you, having never even been here?)

xvk9q,c5q1do9,grizzledanus,"Paying the most taxes you possibly can is not an ethical stance to take, you are not morally obligated to hand over any more to the government than what you legally owe. Paying taxes is not an act of morality but an act of legal necessity.

The problem is that what you legally owe is  not some absolute, it is not a well defined number or percentage. It is a convoluted system in which having good connections can shift this number any way you wish. This is not how a legal system is supposed to work. Legality requires a universal application of laws that everyone can agree is beneficial and apply to everyone without exception.

This is why our tax code and entire legal system are becoming so ineffective. If your laws are no longer absolutes, if your tax codes are 'flexible' then you are no longer living in a system ruled by law but a system ruled by influence and personal connections. If you impose a harsh tax code and strict economic controls that are simply not workable for most businesses, but allow 'wiggle room' you are creating an economic system where corruption is the only way to thrive.

So Romney plays the game he has been put in, and that is fine. He hasn't broken any laws, he hasn't cheated because the rules basically don't exist any more any ways (a non-absolute rule ceases to be a rule).

The real question, the real test of Romney's morality is what he plans to do about this. Does he plan to change the tax code to close the loopholes ? Does he plan to make people pay the same tax regardless of what sort of connections they have ? Fine, cut taxes on the rich if you want, so long as they are all paying. Everyone crying for the rich to pay higher taxes may fail to realize how completely meaningless this would be. The higher the tax rate, in a system with non-absolute tax rates only provides a greater incentive to dodge taxes. Past a certain rate and you can pretty much guarantee everyone will be dodging taxes because anybody who doesn't is going to go under.

1. there is absolutely no evidence of any corruption within the Clinton foundation. It is a nonprofit charity that has raised over 3 billion in the past decade. It has an A rating from charitywatch, one of the leading charity rating organizations and it does not have a rating from the other because of its complex nature. 89% of the money goes to charity. 

2. On the panama papers, there is absolutely no evidence that the free trade agreement increased the amount of offshore banking, in fact, the evidence is the opposite: when negotiations for a free trade agreement with panama began and continuing to after the trade agreement was passed, their activity in Panama decreased since both the US and Europe were pushing for more transparency in Panama as a part of their negotiations for a free trade agreement. 

>Data culled from the documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and presented in several charts on the group’s website, show that the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specialized in setting up offshore accounts and shell companies for wealthy people, has been steadily reducing its activity in Panama for about a decade. As it happens, the decline began about the time the Bush administration and Panama began discussing a free-trade pact — and accelerated after the deal took effect during Mr. Obama’s first term.

Hillary Clinton's tax returns are public in full going back to 1977. She was under no obligation to do this. The Clinton Foundation is not obligated to disclose its donors. It has, anyway.

You only know about her paid Wall Street speeches because she released her tax returns. You only know about Saudi Arabia and Boeing donating to the Clinton Foundation because she told you. You only know that the Clinton Foundation screwed up and forgot (wtf, right?) to disclose a bunch of donations, because they disclosed and corrected the mistake. What you're pointing out are potential conflicts of interest, not lack of transparency. These are conflicts you've discovered because she *is* exceptionally transparent. This is why transparency exists.

Bernie Sanders is uniquely opaque about his finances. He's released only two pages of one year of tax return -- a return he prepared after deciding to run for president. You'd think he'd be eager to contrast his relatively modest income to Hillary's tens of millions of dollars, but he hasn't. When asked about previous tax forms, his campaign has only pledged to release his 2015 return once its filed. He doesn't respond to journalist questions about his personal finances.

And, even though it's not the fault of either of them, the fact that Bernie draws so many small donations means that 2/3 of this campaign's income comes from anonymous sources, preventing the sort of ""Hillary's campaign takes $X amount of money from Wall St. bankers"" observations of any substance.

This is the same campaign that's been repeatedly getting letters from the FEC for shoddy accounting, accepting donations from foreign addresses without verifying citizenship, accepting donations from non-persons, and accepting donations in excess of the legal limit. These are infractions the FEC found from looking only at the 1/3 of his income that's itemized.

Bernie Sanders is the candidate selling himself as the only one uncurroptable by financial interests. He knows -- from supporters' posts like this -- that anything that ties him to any money can be used to create a claim of conflict of interest or hypocrisy. He's chosen to be transparent to avoid this, rather than owning it.",ethical investing

Once she resigned as the Secretary of State, the Deutsche Bank paid her $485,000 for a speech. While criminality can’t yet be definitively established, this may change when the “Süddeutsche Zeitung” publishes its comprehensive list at the end of the month. In addition to the aforementioned connection, Clinton’s name has already surfaced in connection to a billionaire and a Russian-controlled bank named in the files. Which I imagine is a connection to the Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, Tony Podesta, a major Clinton bundler. According to the Washington Free Beacon, which first reported the connection, Sberbank registered with the Podesta Group last month to lobby on issues related to economic sanctions against Russia and on stock and bond trading for its U.S. clients.

lolr6,c2uj7bj,thinkB4Uact,"People don't realize that banks have a monopoly on the creation of currency around the world.  Governments largely do not create their own money.  They sell government bonds to be paid back with interest.  

The ""Federal Reserve"", a privately owned central bank, conjures money out of nothing and loans it to its shareholding member banks at very low interest rates.  The shareholding member banks then loan it out at high interest rates.  On top of that, banks get to create money through fractional reserve lending.  When only a fraction of deposits have to be kept on hand, money can be multiplied.

For simplicity, imagine that there is only 1 bank in the world doing fractional reserve banking at a 10% reserve requirement.  The money multiplier effect works regardless of how many banks there are in the system, but when there is only 1 bank the scam is seen clearly.  John deposits $100 into the bank.  The bank loans Sally $90 to pay Chuck for a bicycle and the bank keeps $10 for its reserve requirement.  Chuck deposits his $90 into his bank account.  The bank can now loan someone else up to $81, keeping $9 for the reserve requirement.  When they loan that $81 to someone else, they'll have loaned out $171 from only $100.  If every penny from each subsequent loan is redeposited into a bank, the multiplier effect approaches 9x the original deposit.  Of course, people spend some of the money, but usually the money ends up as a deposit in a bank somewhere.  It doesn't matter which bank it ends up at, the multiplication occurs nonetheless.  So, it can be said that only banks are allowed to make money, everybody else in society has to earn it.  We should care that these entities get a free ride off of our economy just like we'd care if our neighbor had a money printing press in his basement.  It gives them an unfair economic advantage that burdens everybody with the resultant inflation.  It should be noted that there is not enough money in existence to pay off all debts, principle and interest, because money is created by making loans.  This is not freedom, this is a perpetual treadmill.  ",ethical investing

If you have to use credit, then you can't have the things you're borrowing the money for. I don't care if it's education, housing, or food. That should tell you what you're real life situation and standing is... Borrowing money and paying it off later is indentured slavery that is self imposed. I'm a victim myself.

If people stop giving these dickwads money, and stop financing their lives, and stop buying products and services from assholes, then we won't have this problem. 

If not enough people change, then we'll all put up with it until it blows up in our faces whether we like it or not. To seem surprised that this is censored, and to get disappointed that this is what we get as a global society, is foolish. That just says you weren't paying attention until now. 

I don't need a whistle blower to tell me that things are bad. I've met executives. Lots of them. Some of billion dollar companies, and some from family owned companies spanning multiple generations... Some are good. Some are fucking horrible. 

The only reason we still have assholes in charge of things, is because the common populace hasn't made its top priority learning who's worth supporting as a business owner and who's not. We've been throwing money at the wrong teams, and this is what we get. The egomaniacal, ethically bankrupt leavings of society being allowed to pilot organizations that have the ability to exert their influence over thousands, and in some cases millions of lives. Unfortunately, it's sometimes billions.

Don't work for assholes, don't buy things from assholes, don't even waste your time trying to correct the assholes or allow them ""time to change"". Just make sure that every time you're doing business with someone, or buying something from someone, or even working a shitty job for someone, that they are genuinely a decent human being. If you don't know who's on the board of directors, quit. Today. No matter the consequences, they can't be worse than supporting people you have no idea about, and causing the rest of the globe to suffer the shit you're helping to pump out. For every megalomaniac you forgo your income to avoid supporting, I promise you there are three small, startup-like bosses that would love to have an invested and ethically sound worker that are getting railroaded by large scale competitors that seem to never have a problem finding employees because their brand is huge and they don't even have to try to be an ethical employer to attract desperate and lazy job searchers. 

I just hope more communities start focusing on their ability to hold individuals accountable for not shitting on others to make their money. If you have a douchebag in your city... run them out. If you have an HQ of a mega-shit-house in your neck of the woods, tell them to find someplace else to shit. Make the mega banks feel like Snowden. They should have no home. They should find no solace. They should be shunned by every community, until they realize that no group is willing to condone their bullshit.

1hn6rd,caw4iqp,,"In one of her writings she also mentions [BlackRock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock) among others to have a lot of influence on the world bank, a asset managing firm which holds 12 trillion dollar worth of assets in the world, and interestingly has access to datacenters and 5000 computers running their risk management calculations, information which is very valuable for wallstreet. They're very close to the government and also helped them to clean up sideeffects of the 2008 crisis.

Sources for the BlackRock data mining (page 3): http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/fink-201004

> But while its size was impressive, what would distinguish BlackRock was its state- of-the-art system for evaluating and managing risk. With 5,000 computers running 24 hours a day, overseen by a team of engineers, mathematicians, analysts, and programmers, BlackRock’s “computer farm” could monitor millions of daily trades and scrutinize every single security in its clients’ investment portfolios to see how they would be affected by even the most minor changes in the economy. Churning through 200 million calculations each week, its computers could simulate every imaginable shift in interest rates, every conceivable change in the financial markets, and stress-test the performance of hundreds of thousands of securities in numerous global-crisis scenarios.

> Known as Aladdin, the system was effectively a multi-billion-dollar computerized worrywart, searching the markets for anything that could go wrong. And it would become the foundation for a second business that would expand BlackRock’s reach beyond asset management, into the business of advising clients for whom things had gone wrong. Officially formed in 2000, the BlackRock Solutions division now has about 140 clients, the best known of which happens to be the U.S. government.

> With Aladdin, BlackRock Solutions’ 600 employees can evaluate a client’s holdings in a day, grinding through a $30 billion portfolio—as it did with Bear Stearns in March 2008. It can also manage a client’s portfolio long-term—as it is currently doing for the three investment vehicles (known as Maiden Lane I, II, and III) that hold the $130 billion of A.I.G. and Bear Stearns assets taken over by the New York Fed in the fall of 2008. For other clients—such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the New York Fed’s $1.2 trillion in mortgage securities—it simply monitors the portfolio around the clock and can provide daily risk-assessment reports. BlackRock also “rents” the use of Aladdin to about 40 clients, providing them with all its services but still controlling the systems from its headquarters. It is through Aladdin that BlackRock effectively has an electronic eye on investments that amount to about $9 trillion worldwide.

I guess that this is the main reason for the spying on the people and politicians, to reduce the errors and make the markets predictable. Take in mind that shares on wallstreet are usually held only for a few seconds.

1) 401k contributions are a direct loss to the company and are literally the same as wages to employees over the long term. By not calling them an expense, and hence untaxable, you will be destroying people's retirements across the US.

2) Equipment/Supplies - yeah, no shit people don't pay taxes on things that aren't profit. For example, my business made (imaginarily) $100k last year in income. BUT, to get that, I had to spend $50k in computers for the business, software liscenses, paper, desks, the building, marketing materials, sub-contractors, rent, etc. You're telling me that I should pay 30% tax on the FUCKING SUPPLIES I'm buying for my business? Fuck off. That literally means that I could lose money (100k income, 120k expenses for a loss of $20k) and still have to pay taxes. 

3) Mileage and gas don't get written off for company cars. It's written off for THE PERSON who owns the car. It covers the wear and tear that you put on the car while driving, and is fairly accurate in terms of cost.

I like your ideas, but have to question this one if I'm reading it correctly. Shouldn't it be the other way around, where companies are penalized for foreign manufacturing, but do receive credits for domestic manufacturing?

The quickest way to bring jobs back to America is to make it too expensive for businesses to outsource their manufacturing (and customer service) to places like China and India. If a company wants to make a product in China and import it, fine -- but charge them a tariff equal to 50% of their final retail price on that product, per unit. 

Likewise, use the difference between what they're paying outsourced employees per hour and federal minimum wage to raise the floor on what they can deduct as wages. For example, if they have a hundred outsourced employees working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks at $1.25 an hour, for $ 260,000, we subtract that from the same hundred employees working at $ 7.25 an hour and get $1,248,000.00 -- and so, the first $ 1.248 million in all wages are not deductible as a business expense, but they would be if they were going to American workers.

And, in all cases, keep the loopholes in place for companies with fewer than a certain amount of employees (100 in two or fewer locations?), or less than a certain amount (five million?) of annual gross revenue. This way, we encourage small business, make big business pay their fair share, and bring jobs back to America.",ethical investing

q7h1c,c3vfe29,Franholio,"Downvoted. Your biggest source of revenue, a financial transactions tax, is a bad idea for several reasons. You mentioned that it reduces liquidity, which is true. About 70% of all trading is automated HFT - that would dry up overnight and cannibalize revenue, much more than the 25% estimate the report cited. Furthermore, it's impossible to distinguish between automated and non-automated orders.

On the derivatives end, a tax has two glaring flaws. First, it makes derivatives even riskier. There are two kinds of derivatives: exchange-traded derivatives, traded over exchanges in the same way as stocks; and over-the-counter derivatives, which are traded privately between two parties, usually over a phone call. Over-the-counter derivatives are a completely unregulated market, and would probably be impossible to regulate. Exchange-traded derivatives can be regulated. This tax would shift the derivatives market away from the exchange-traded model and towards the unregulated OTC model, when any sensible economist would try to do the opposite.

But the biggest flaw in the plan is a gross misunderstanding of the way derivatives work. A quick glance at the CPC report shows that the proposal would tax derivatives at their notional value - the theoretical value of all assets underlying all contracts. By some accounts, the total notional value of the entire derivatives market is between $600 trillion and $1.2 quadrillion - tremendous numbers used to fearmonger. Of course, this money doesn't actually exist, so taxing it doesn't make any sense. It would be like sending me Warren Buffett's tax bill and being shocked when I can't pay it.

The actual value of the derivatives market, measured by net value, is around $11 trillion - much smaller than the stock market, or even US GDP. But this amount is still too large, since the US imposes taxes on income, not wealth. Instead, we have to find out the annual change in value of the derivatives market. Such statistics aren't kept, but let's assume growth by the same amount as GDP, 2.5% annually. This takes the $11 trillion figure down to $275 billion.

Of course, that's the global figure. The US derivatives trade makes up a quarter of that, or $70 billion. Actually, this figure is probably still too high - in the last three quarters, banks reported [combined trading revenues of $28 billion](http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/index-derivatives.html), translating to under $40 billion annually. So a $65 billion annual tax would literally tax more money than banks make in a year. Still sure it's a good idea?

First off only $16 Billion of the $90 billion was used for loans.

The government knew that some risk was needed and set aside $2.47 billion to cover losses. Current estimates show that the number will be much lower then that. Right now that's only a 2.6% default rate.

n7azg,c36thue,p0ssum,"There are so many problems with this, its hard to know where to begin.

|A tax, in short, is an assumed fee for services provided by the government (local, state, national).

There are many different taxes for many different things. This is a false premise. Taxes are NOT for services rendered.

Next, you try to equate a home owners budget, with that of a federal government. That is simply not possible, nor should it be attempted. There are times of War and Disaster where a government, must and is expected to run deficits. It's how you address those deficits that is important, as they are unavoidable. Another false premise.


|It doesn't make logical or ethical sense to tax some differently than others, so you have to raise taxes on everybody equally via whatever form that takes (some form of indirect tax, you know, gas and sales and things).

Don't we already have this? What am I missing here? Isn't this the big hole in the 53% argument? Those people pay everything but PAYROLL taxes.


| Technically, yes, you can raise taxes on the richer of us. Technically (sometimes) it'll yield more revenue. But if you're at the stage where THAT is your only option, chances are the revenue you earn from these people won't be enough (and it isn't now, not even close) to paying off the deficit, never mind the debt.

Rolling back the Bush Tax Cuts, and a few additional changes, alone would pay off the debt. From the CBO:

However, the CBO also says the deficit could be fixed almost completely simply by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire as scheduled in 2012 and broadening the alternative minimum tax. 


|or they'll just migrate their business or their home to another area. They're rich, they can do that kind of stuff.

| Their money would be better spent doing charity work or starting a business whose goal it is to make the world a better place to be (I personally think a real Jurassic Park would be a wonderful investment), but it's their choice of what to do with their money.

Problem is, they don't. They hoard the wealth to make more wealth, and don't pay taxes on it, you know that whole capital gains being taxed at less than payroll taxes.

| The final point I want to make is that the more you tax people, really any people, the less they'll want to give to charities that are directly helping people. 

Ahh, the old, let the charities do it. What about the charities that discriminate, both willfully and openly?

> When a person joins the military, their own free will is replaced by the chain of command, and ultimately, the free will of the government.

I think I understand where this is coming from, but I think the ground-level experience is far different from what you're alluding to, and actually contradictory.

This is the contradiction. A young soldier has free will and absolute discretion over his trigger, and leaders have discretion and free will in their orders, ""guided by laws that essentially define the limits of how [he] may impose [his] will on others. Within this framework [he has] the broad power to choose our own actions"". Furthermore, as you state yourself ""the righteous exercise of free will is the most constant, difficult, intimidating challenge that we are faced with in our lives. People who are concerned with morality must not only determine the (often complex) consequences of their actions, but also balance their own needs with the needs of others. To do this requires unceasing courage and resolve."" I'd posit that there is no more complex moral puzzle than the modern battlefield. A 19 year old soldier can shape the tactical battlespace and the strategic policy with a single stroke of a trigger, a single radio call, or a single conversation with a local.

As such, we should specifically recruit our most moral, most ethical young men for service. Not assume that they serve because of trickery, misunderstanding, or an inherent lack of moral anchoring.",ethical investing

You lose a measure of free will, but again that is no different than having a corporate job with its rules, regs and chain of command.

Is the soldier immoral for following orders and committing immoral acts? Yeah, probably. There is a lot of honor and duty in the military, and this is good and desirable, but it's also true that those words cover up a lot of questionable behavior and action. When I was young and dumb, I volunteered for service. I would not do so now, because my views on killing and violence have evolved.

I know quite a few 'working rich' (doctors, engineers, managers, etc) who contemplate less hours in exchange for things they value more than after-tax money.

Progressively taxing consumption however is a much better idea. Essentially you have a sales tax proportional to the price of the item you purchase. From a commodities standpoint the more expensive the good the more incentive to conserve it.

1.  Great wealth disparity is natural and good and any attempt by government to achieve more equality is considered, illegitimate, even immoral. (This means opposition to tax supported education, health care, protection of individual rights, (if you have wealth you don't need protection.)

2.  The bible is the rule book for intimate conduct and religion is a partner to government for maintaining public order. (Yes, the godless Ayn Rand influenced libertarians are part of the ultra-conservative movement. Contradictions are no problem, the libertarians just say leave religion to the individual states, and will endorse any law that limits individual rights against an employer, wealthy individual or business.)



3.  Capital must never bow to labor as they like to put it. 
No min. wage, no overtime pay,  no OSHA, no fair employment practices. (why they hate labor unions)
No health care coverage except for executive/management. (this exists at WalMart and many companies)

Not only were those wars started by the current guy's predecessor, they were financed ""off budget"" (i.e. on the federal deficit) by the previous Congress.

First, do you have enough experience to really know what you're talking about? It sounds like you may, but realistically only about 5-10% of first year students would have the ability to interpret complex data/approaches to the point of knowing scientific misconduct. It is much more likely that YOU don't know what you're talking about. Everyone is going to give your PI the benefit of the doubt, he has the publication record after all. 

I think this statement is telling...""The PI, however, was more than happy to take the lion's share of the credit and state that he came up with the ideas..."" Why wouldn't he take credit? It's his lab, it sounds like he identified a niche in his research program and made a strategic hire to take advantage of it. Does he have to understand every nuance? Right now I'm the most experienced person in my lab, but I would readily hire a post-doc that could do something that I don't understand completely. Hopefully I'll learn, but I don't have to be an expert on everything in my lab.

Everything else you mention is a personality thing. Maybe you don't jive, who knows. But to take it to the level of scientific misconduct, I would have to consider if you are simply unprepared for graduate school and working in a lab setting. 

I'm just throwing these out there to give you an idea of what other faculty will be thinking. They have invested a LOT of money in this PI, startup package anywhere from $250-750K, salary paid for several years, etc. The department will want the faculty to succeed, and honestly, in these situations, the majority of time it is the student who simply doesn't understand. 

Now how to solve the problem. First you obviously have to leave the lab, you don't have faith in the PI and you will either quit of fail. My suggestion is to go to the director of your graduate program and tell him that things are not working out. Don't go into detail, but tell him that you don't feel like you can succeed and would like to change labs. Get some suggestions from him on how to approach the situation. Ideally he will be on your side, and if you keep the personal out of the equation, it shouldn't be a problem. The last thing you want to do is go through the wrong channels and have it bite you in the ass at the end. For example, if you contact a PI about an opening, and he happens to play golf every weekend with your mentor? Also, the first thing I would if you came to me is contact your mentor.

That's where LTV seems to have its greatest difficulty.

Land has the issue that nobody makes it, and therefore how we come to have a *right* to land, at least initially, remains a point of philosophical difficulty. But, assuming someone owns the land, there would still be the difficulty or trouble of making use of it. If Crusoe owns several islands nearby, the value imbued on anything grown upon it would be a product of the difficulty of traveling to them.

Time is also a bit strange, because labour exists in time, and is in some sense, the means by which labour 'dies'. But it seems to me that the real cost of time is the cost of the 'work' waiting, or that this passage must be witnessed. You could imagine that if the wine aging in the barrels required no maintenance, and Crusoe could simply go into stasis and experience the jump instantaneously, then we'd have a different story.

I'm lazy so I'm just going to do the quote-respond format. 

>So, the LTV is right and even when it's wrong that proves that it's still right? 

Let's go back to the quote: 

>Providing examples of prices diverging from embodied labor time does not falsify/refute Marx’s theory because he does not claim that empirical prices always reflect embodied labor time or that prices empirically gravitate around a center of gravity based on value in the manner that neoclassical theory theorizes equilibrium price 

You would be right if the quote was 

>Providing examples of prices diverging from embodied labor time does not falsify/refute Marx’s theory because he ... claim[s] that empirical prices always reflect embodied labor time and that prices empirically gravitate around a center of gravity based on value in the manner that neoclassical theory theorizes equilibrium price 

but the quote specifically noted that Marx never argued that empirical prices will always reflect embodied labour time. As we see in the [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DWC_m-eIWO0) [1] I linked below, it isn't that Marx thinks that prices and value are the same thing or that supply and demand are irrelevant to the determination of prices, it's that they are *necessary* to explain the deviation of prices from values [2]  

>A system of economic theory must be able to explain prices. Even if you believe that prices are a surface phenomenon of some sort it's still necessary to explain them. Indeed, if prices really are a symptom of something deeper then explaining them should be simple to those who understand that deeper thing. And, explaining prices should be harder for those who don't understand it.

Yes, and the TSSI interpretation of the labour theory of value does that very well! It's described [in depth](https://kapitalism101.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/law-of-value-10-price-and-value/) here (along with a helpful critique of the Cockshottian arguments). The most relevant quotes are:

>This feedback loop could be confusing unless we remember this important principle:

>>‘value cannot be created in exchange’

>Once you understand this almost everything else falls into place. Value is created in production by human labor. It takes the form of commodities with definite values. Commodities enter the market place where they acquire prices. Sometimes these prices are above their values. Sometimes below. These signals act back upon production to discipline and apportion labor. Thus the enormous, complex division of labor in a capitalist society is coordinated through the value relations between the commodities.

>Because value cannot be created in exchange this means that the exchange of commodities is a zero-sum game. If some commodities sell above values then others must sell below. There can be no aggregate increase in value merely through the process of commodities changing owners. To have new value there must be new labor.

This is what the TSSI interpretation of Marx sees *values* relating to each other.

For *prices*, the theory of supply and demand is used to describe the deviation of prices from values:

>One of the main reasons that prices deviate from values is the constant fluctuations of demand and supply. As capital revolutionizes the productivity of labor, values change, output and prices change, and demand and supply fluctuate. If demand for jellybeans is higher than supply then the prices of jellybeans rise above their values, they command more abstract labor in exchange, and this triggers a reapportioning of labor to bring supply in line with demand.

...

>If the supply and demand of yo-yos, jellybeans and all other commodities magically balanced, then prices would equal values. (That is, if we are abstracting from prices of production.) But if this was the case we wouldn’t have much need for price. We’d automatically know how much labor input went into anything we demanded and we could just organize everything on a computer without a market.

And one final note on the TSSI interpretation; it theorizes prices as a consequence of a number of factors. It's also compatible with some Post-Keynesian models for prices.  

So when /u/RobThorpe finally sheds the Ricardian labour theory of price here:

>Some suggest that the inequalities all balance out. So, that when one good is sold for less than it's labour-value that means another good must be sold for more than it's labour-value. This leads to an aggregate theory where all final income is proportional to all labour-value across the economy. (I can put this in a mathematical form if anyone is interested.) This is a view Marx leans towards in the end. This theory has the benefit that it's a proper theory. 

I think less that Marx tended towards the view ""in the end"", but that he was always a proponent of it. You can see it in Kapital Volume III, and I think Kapital Volume I, but obviously in the Grundrisse [2]

>The idea that labour values determine prices except when they don't isn't really a theory. 

This isn't the point that the writer from Kapitalism101 is making, as they are an adherent to the TSSI interpretation. 

>This leads to an aggregate theory where all final income is proportional to all labour-value across the economy 

> ...

>However, careful thought shows the problems with this aggregate theory.

The aggregate theory is rather that the sum of prices is equal to the sum of (the monetary expression of) labour times, not that incomes (?) are proportional to labour-values. 

Mathematical form is that at time t, [; \sum P(t) = τ(t) \cdot \sum L(t) ;], where [; τ(t) ;] is the MELT at time t, [; L(t) ;] is the labour hours at time t, and [; P(t) ;] are the prices at time t. 

You're getting something right! Unfortunately, we see something at least relatively irrelevant pop up: 

>Let's say that Robinson Crusoe plants some vines to make wine. He pressed the grape juice and stores the wine in barrels that have washed up on his island. Then, some years after he has laid down the first barrels he opens them up and starts drinking.

>In this process Crusoe has sacrificed three things. Firstly, he has sacrificed the land for vines. His island only has a finite amount of land and he has taken a portion of it an used it for this purpose. Of course, if land is plentiful this may not be a large sacrifice. Secondly, he has sacrificed his labour in planting the vines and making the wine. Lastly, he has sacrificed his time in waiting for the wine to mature. He could have done something else with his labour that provided an immediate return.

That there are background conditions (time, land) necessary for the transformation of materials into commodities is not a refutation of Marx's theory; Marx never thought that time and land are unnecessary for the production of commodities, he just thought they never contributed to *value*. 

This confused me: what is the relevance of land and time to Marx's theory of value? Obviously, if we were talking about how labour values determine prices (the Ricardian labour theory of value), then this would be an interesting *conceptual objection* [3]. But Marx's theory applies to how *labour times determine values* (of commodities, of course).",ethical investing

> I'm gonna argue that the Philips curve is much stronger for unexpected NGDP growth than unexpected inflation. 

This is a cool graph, but I think this comparison is an artefact of living in a world of inflation targeting, i.e. is endogenous to the policy regime. Under perfect inflation targeting, the Phillips curve would be flat -- you might already be familiar with [Nick Rowe on Milton Friedman's thermostat](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2010/12/milton-friedmans-thermostat.html) (or formalized in [McLeahy and Tenreyro 2019](http://papers.nber.org/conf_papers/f115615.pdf)).

Edit: point being that, if the Fed adopted strict NGDP (rate) targeting, then the NGDP Phillips curve in the US would be flat.

3\. ""Supply shocks""

Somewhat just playing devil's advocate here: take the negative oil shock example Bernanke gives. Inflation goes up, output goes down. NGDP targeting would only ignore this if there's a one-to-one relationship there, i.e. for every 1pp increase inflation the natural rate of output growth falls 1pp. 

That seems very knife-edge. Why prefer NGDP targeting to what the Fed currently does with ""flexible inflation targeting"", where they use discretion to [purport to] ignore supply shocks, typically, in a flexible way that doesn't impose a one-to-one straitjacket?

(One good-if-not-perfect response here IMO: NGDP targeting can be thought of as a formalization of flexible inflation targeting in a way that is transparent and reduces unnecessary discretion.)",ethical investing

>Economists from both the U.S and Europe on the IGM Forum rated given causes of the financial crisis from most important to least important, and they concluded that poor regulation and oversight of the financial system was the most important cause of the crisis. Poor incentives and fraud were also an important cause. So while Arthur Brooks is correct in blaming the government, he doesn't describe their role correctly; the government should've intervened more, not less.

I am pretty sure this is not what you meant (as it is a sum up with financial oversight, regulation, and fraud/criminal behavior) but this makes it sound as if there is agreement on the fact that there should have been *more* regulation. The phrasing of the question however makes it such that there is agreement on the fact that there should've been more *or* different regulation. I feel as if the distinction is important, as in reality, solely ''increasing regulation'' by creating more and more complex rules often results in de facto de-regulation or the creation of many loopholes and alike. I am not in a position to argue whether should be more or different, but I do think consensus might have been lower if the question would have just stated more.

ad0lqh,eddgpes,labbelajban,"
Please explain to me why my view of the crash isn’t true, because I can’t seem to find a keynsian argument that is satisfactory and doesn’t ignore basic economics. 

The financial crisis wasn’t caused by “muh greedy and unregulated banks” at least its more nuanced. 

The government wanted to help “muh poor people” so Fannie May and Freddy Mac, government enterprises, ignored the interest equilibrium and the balance of risk vs reward which the banks, acting free of government influence would have sat comfortably in, also the community reinvestment act of 1977 forces banks to loan out money to low income borrowers. Thus mortgages were taken on without regard for the risk and so short circuited the interest rate equilibrium, this coupled with the federal reserves artificially low interest rates, drove huge amounts of high risk borrowers, that wouldn’t have been there weren’t it for government intervention. 

This corresponds to an increase in demand for housing and thus it increased the price of housing and the quantity of housing produced. Keep this in mind.

So when the economy takes even a slight downturn that doesn’t have to equate to a great financial rescission, makes it so that all these risky borrowers that are living pay check to pay check, suddenly cannot keep paying their mortgages. 

Thusly, they exit the market and the demand for housing sharply decreases, but the houses still exist, and so everyone is scrambling to sell their houses, thus a sharp increase in supply. Then we saw as we all know, a huge decline in the price of housing and thus the crash of the housing market which then spiralled out of control and everything went into the crapper. 

Essentially what happened was that the government and thus the tax payer took on all the risks and the banks could reap all the profit without any of the risks. 

The banks only behaved in such a greedy and irresponsible way because the government, the fed, Freddy Mac and fanny may, the community reinvestment act, the HUD (1996), urged them to do so,

Not France. France is the most unfree country in Northwestern Europe according to the same index. I think that's generally what people refer to. Everyone kind of recognizes that Germany is pretty free, same with the UK, etc. There's a lot of confusion perpetuated about Scandinavia in particular, largely because leftists like to call those countries socialist without knowing what the word socialist means, and conservatives proceeded to fall right into the trap and started basically making shit up about those countries.",ethical investing

(I've talked about Friedman-Stigler As-If methodology [before](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/506lms/pseudoscience_check_evonomics_yep/d72ktgj?st=isl06a9h&sh=6b357da0), but I'm reading Blaug and rereading Rodrik now so expect some hopefully better thoughts soon.)

Friedman was many good things, but a good philosopher of science/economics, he was not. The goal of economics is not to just predict things regardless of the ridiculousness of the assumptions we make. If that were true, and we found virtue in unrealistic assumptions, then we'd be unable to isolate many relevant causal mechanisms and we'd be data miners, unable to explain many phenomena. 

Back to your point about prediction, does this mean the theory of evolution is invalid? This is the classic example of a theory universally considered scientific yet unable to predict, only explain.

>Are we told that foreign aid is always mismanaged and appropriated by corrupt dictatorships? Are we told that nonprofits displace the responsibilities and services of local governments and encourage long term dependency? Are we even told that charity is a band-aid used to cover up and perpetuate the wretched abuses of global capital?

To be fair, we don't really have a modern, formal model of the effects of foreign aid on economic growth. Acemoglu et. al. and Easterly have called attention to mismanagement, extraction, path dependence, and moral hazard, but Easterly [argues](http://www.development.wne.uw.edu.pl/uploads/Courses/dev_easterly_2003.pdf) we still haven't gotten around to writing down an actual model of the channels through which aid causes growth or anything else, if at all.",ethical investing

5ouqwv,dcmgm8u,ivansml,"Well, I'm honored to be a subject of R1 for the first time :)

However, you seem to be more or less restating Romer's point which I've found unconvincing in the first place. Repeating something does not make it more true or more profound.

Look, of course one could discuss interpretation of structural shocks, or issues of identification, or justification for various modelling tricks in macro models. There are hundreds of papers which do exactly that as a part of normal scientific process. However Romer does not engage this literature, he's just using these vague, nonspecific complaints (which could be made against any field, really) as a beating stick to dismiss the whole field of macroeconomics without offering any constructive alternative.

It's as if I wrote a paper ""Trouble with applied microeconomics"" where I claimed that the field is garbage because it suffers from wide-spread identification problems, ignores general equilibrium effects and has no way of dealing with external validity concerns. I wouldn't discuss specific failings in the literature, but instead illustrate my point with a few contrived artificial examples and some anecdotes heard at micro seminars. Even though there is a grain of truth behind all of these complaints, would you take such paper seriously?

Some more specific comments:

> DSGE is based on RBC and has to use microfoundational kludges like the Calvo fairy to make money matter. [...] The issue is that a lot of these shocks are exogenous and not based on individual behavior

So what? You could write more complex model where the stickiness of prices is derived from optimal choices of firms facing menu costs, or where time preference shocks are a result of varying idiosyncratic risk faced by households, but that does not mean that every paper should necessarily do so. ""Microfounded"" is a matter of degree, not a binary concept, and an optimal position on the microfoundation-tractability curve depends on the context. Unfortunately Romer does not offer any arguments about how we should choose that point, or why the current choice is wrong, he's merely shouting ""you claim to have microfoundations, but they're only partial, so you're full of shit"".

> without expectation formation at all there are less parameters. If you follow the way he builds up the problem he is showing that RE does not solve the identification problems in the previous section, only those introduced by thinking about expectations in the first place. Romer is not anti-expectations, he merely says that RE doesn't alone provide enough identification for a basic macro model.

Right, RE (or any other expectations-formation process) provides restrictions for the unrestricted model that includes forward-looking terms, but inclusion of those terms by itself makes the identification problem worse compared to backwards-only model. Unfortunately there is a wide consensus that expectations matter, so using a backward-looking model as a benchmark makes no sense. From reading the paper, I didn't get the impression that Romer understands the distinction here.

> The DSGE issue is the worst of his taxonomy: identification by obfuscation. It's just burying the FWUTV's even deeper than the usual micro theory approach. ""We can meaningfully discuss"" means that ""people trained in DSGE model math"" can meaningfully discuss. Say an empirical labor economist finds out something with a clever IV. Could they jump into a DSGE model and fix the microfoundations? No.

I'm sorry that reading MHE does not make one an expert macroeconomist and that one may need to learn tools beyond `ivregress y x=z, robust` to do research. Such is life.

> I mean, you're not wrong that he has a personal axe to grind with the freshwater gang. But who else has that level of working experience within macroeconomic theory who also has the career security to afford to make powerful enemies within the community?

Any senior macroeconomics professor with tenure? Senior people write critical stuff all the time, but only Romer has embarked on a personal crusade. Some men just want to watch the world burn.

6kb2zk,djkz335,,"I think this is a good write-up that explains the intent behind an individual mandate. However, I think you fail to address the [Heritage Foundation's key argument for increased recruitment](http://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/better-the-status-quo-senate-health-care-bill-still-misses-major):

>This change would allow insurers to once again charge young adults premiums commensurate with their lower expected medical costs, and thus price their plans to be more attractive to younger, healthier individuals. It reverses Obamacare’s “age-rating compression,” which significantly increased premiums for young adults—contributing to lower-than-expected enrollment by those individuals in Obamacare-compliant coverage.

Keep in mind, they aren't attempting to say that individual mandates as a concept are flawed, but rather that the ACA's versions of them are. The Heritage Foundation is arguing about the status quo as it is: piecemeal Medicaid expansion and weak mandates considered. 

Health economists agree with this consensus, as you [linked here](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/24/12538934/is-obamacare-failing):

>Many of those I spoke with in the insurance industry were especially frustrated with the individual mandate, which they found to be too weak and poorly enforced, leading to lower-than-expected enrollment among healthy, young adults. The White House hoped that young adults would make up 38 percent of enrollees; right now they’re about 28 percent of the marketplace population.

While the CBO does estimate that enrollment goes down, much of that is based on the immediate short term: 15 million will lose insurance in the next year, with most of them opting out by choice because the mandate is lifted. 

The market may very well adjust for this, as premiums for younger, healthier individuals will go down by broadening the age corridor from 3-to-1 to 5-to-1. This may entice not only the drop-outs, but also the hold-outs: the non-elderly population that does not have insurance is typically concentrated in the South (and are barred from Medicaid either due to immigration or lack of expansion), and are around middle-income, but can't afford current rates.

The Heritage Foundation seems to believe that if premiums can be lowered to entice this younger, middle-income crowd, we will witness this rubberband-effect, where people opt-out willingly and opt-in willingly when the market responds and begins offering bronze and silver plans at lower rates to younger and less risky individuals.

I think you can develop your argument on the ""lock-out effect"" that the House coverage penalty will create in conjunction with the Senate's mandated 6-month wait.

Microfounding everything was a massive methodological advancement.  But the exact form of the micro foundations always seemed arbitrary or a matter of mathematical convenience.  How do we decide which micro data that we're going to match and which we're not going to care about?   The standard answer is that it's going to depend on what question we're asking and what we want the model to do.  But there's a certain amount of ambiguity here, and the danger is that researchers priors can come in to play.    Same with shocks.   The way shocks are added to the model also feels ad-hoc.  At it's worst it feels like it's overfitting.

Primarily in his discussion of *long-run growth,* a topic on which basically everyone agrees that monetary policy is a triviality (outside of hyperinflations and other systematic institutional failures).

----

Has it occurred to Romer that monetary policy shocks are small precisely because monetary policymakers tend to be academic economists and are actively engaged in the business of keeping monetary shocks small?

For all of his talk of the identification problem, he fails to consider that one. Indeed a world where money matters, but the monetary authority keeps monetary shocks small, is almost impossible to distinguish from an RBC world. Part of the point of good monetary policy is to make the world look as if Prescott were right, and we indeed did a good job of that for about a quarter-century after 1982.

I can simultaneously believe that:

1. Money matters for business cycles,
2. Monetary shocks have, historically, been small on average
3. Hence monetary shocks account for a small portion of the variance of output over the postwar period
4. In the few episodes for which we have identified monetary shocks, they seem to matter a great deal

Similarly, it's true that:

1. Oil supply shocks matter for business cycles,
2. Oil supply shocks have, historically, been small *on average*,
3. Hence oil shocks account for a small portion of the variance in output over the postwar period,
4. In the few episodes for which we have identified oil supply shocks, them seem to matter a great deal

Similarly credit supply shocks.

Romer ought to especially like oil supply shocks: you can reach out and touch them, especially given the institutional arrangements in place before 1980. Phlogiston they are not. (You can't touch monetary shocks, except in rare cases. Why are they acceptable but other unobservable shocks are not acceptable?)

[Footnote: If I may give my actual opinion for once: Oil and money really are the two main shocks, with credit supply shocks mattering in certain sharp intervals. High-frequency movement in the technological frontier is fairly unimportant, and tax/government shocks matter more for the 3-10 year horizon than the 1-5 year horizon. It is all about oil and money. Unfortunately, monetary shocks since 1982 have been exceptionally small, and monetary shocks pre-1982 are almost hopelessly confounded with oil supply shocks. I'm not saying that all is lost, just that the data is nowhere near clean enough to just eyeball the relevant time series.]

Really, this paper is the gift that keeps on giving.

>If the Fed can cause a 500 basis point change in interest rates, it is absurd to
wonder if monetary policy is important. Faced with the data in Figure 2, the only
way to remain faithful to dogma that monetary policy is not important is to argue
that despite what people at the Fed thought, they did not change the Fed funds rate...

Suppose I think that conditional on a monetary shock, output and inflation move; but that historically, monetary shocks have been small. Then I could simultaneously think that the Fed can cause a 500 basis point change in real interest rates, but also claim that monetary policy is unimportant for business cycles (since the shocks themselves were, on average, small).

Come on, Romer, this is first-year stuff. The variance of the shock matters just as much as the conversion coefficient in the regression.

4. He is actually arguing any expectations make identification harder. Rat-ex makes identifying cross-equation restrictions that do address this. I think his point is that he doesn't like that macro theorists use unrealistic assumptions to identify the models.

6. That's just a simple example. His point is that no amount of deduction or obfuscation makes an identifying assumption more than an assumption. 

7.& 8. are just trying to explain the sociology of science that would cause such problems. He's definitely salty but that doesn't inherently mean he's wrong.

The big picture is he's arguing that identifying by assumption in macro is bad because the acceptable assumptions are not based on empirics but are based on academic politics.",ethical investing

Can't you? I don't know that much about the war on drugs, but couldn't reducing the availability of drugs and therefore increasing their price be seen as a success? When law enforcement efforts increase the price of drugs, they celebrate the harm they've done to supply rather than thinking that the increase in rewards must have lead to an increase in supply.

I think the Mises institute is reasoning from a price change.

The Mises criticism doesn't address the concerns of conservationists. If people think that it's wrong to kill whales; wants to stop whales being killed; then the institute's suggestions are useless. Even if property rights were allocated then would the Mises institute they should be given to conservationists or whalers, or auctioned off? How should the auction be run? Perhaps the Mises institute should trust humans to act in their best interests.

I've heard some libertarians make this weird argument that certain species are going extinct is because of the government inability to save them and that the real solution is to privatize polar bears and black rhinos. 

I seriously doubt however anyone could ""domesticate"" enough 80-100 ft blue whales to have a viable breeding population. Aside from the unimaginably large amount of space and food they would need there is no guarantee they would survive in captivity either. Some people have attempted to put great white sharks in aquariums and the sharks all died or just banged their heads on the walls/glass. Also, keeping them in captivity or domesticating them would defeat the purpose of wildlife conservation. 

I once had an intro to macro book that claimed that privatization was the reason why there are so many chicken and cows and why elephants and rhinos are going extinct. Firstly, chickens and cows are barley seen as living things and are viewed more as products with little regard for their well being there is a reason why some animals are more plentiful then others. I don't think factory farming tigers or sharks is what conservationists have in mind when they talk about preserving wildlife. Yes, factory farming tigers would make more of them, but it would defeat the purpose of trying to save them. The book mentioned how some countries in Africa had seen a slight rise in black rhino populations by letting landowners ""fence and manage"" the population for hunters and tourists. This isn't really what people had in mind when they wanted to save them. The book also ignored how India had increased its rhino population mostly through the government working with NGO wildlife groups in the 20th century. 

Secondly, and more importantly, some species lend themselves to domestication far more readily than others. Elephants only live in certain places, they need a lot of food, a lot of space and only give birth to one(in very rare cases two) offspring after a gestation period of about 22 months. Pigs are prolific breeders, relatively mild mannered, opportunistic omnivores, and can adapt to a fairly wide range of habitats. We domesticated certain plants and animals because we could. Theoretically we could genetically develop a new rhino or elephant that breeds faster but that would once again defeat the purpose of species conservation. Creating a ""new"" elephant would't save the old one. ",ethical investing

### Ethics law loopholes allow him to profit from his decisions and actions

### Trudeau Cabinet should appoint an unbiased, experienced foreign service officer as Canada’s Ambassador to China

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:**  
Wednesday, February 5, 2020

OTTAWA – Today, with Canada’s new Ambassador to China Dominic Barton scheduled to testify this evening before the [special House Committee on Canada-China relations](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/CACN/Meetings), Democracy Watch called on the Trudeau Cabinet to replace him with an experienced foreign service officer who doesn’t have the financial conflicts of interest that Barton has.

Because of disclosure rules in Canada’s [*Conflict of Interest Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-36.65/), and other public disclosures, we know that [investments of Mr. Barton and his spouse Geraldine Buckingham](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canadas-envoy-to-china-sets-up-ethical-screen-puts-investments-in/) in McKinsey & Company, and BlackRock Inc., combined with his spouse’s work as BlackRock Inc.’s [Chair for the Asia Pacific region](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/leadership/geraldine-buckingham), tie them into the interests of [at least 22 of China’s biggest 100 state-owned companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/world/asia/mckinsey-china-russia.html), and [generally with wealthy Chinese investors](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/08/larry-fink-just-revealed-how-blackrock-is-going-to-keep-growing-at-its-torrent-pace-china.html).

Mr. Barton also has investments in [four private equity funds](http://prciec-rpccie.parl.gc.ca/EN/PublicRegistries/Pages/Client.aspx?k=2e744141-78d5-e911-8105-001dd8b7242d), including [one located in the Cayman Islands](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1774097/000177409719000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml), and [another with a Caymans connection that appears in the Offshore Leaks/Paradise Papers Database](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024095). Neither of these funds disclose the full list of their investments. The other two funds invest in companies in the healthcare, computer technology, biotechnology, financial services, China real estate, insurance, mining, food, chemicals, construction beauty and education sectors.

Mr. Barton and his spouse also have investments in Teck Resources Ltd., a Vancouver-based mining company that has the [China Investment Corporation](http://www.china-inv.cn/en/) as [one of its biggest investors](https://www.teck.com/news/news-releases/2017/cic-advises-partial-sale-of-teck-position). And he is invested in an American AI company called SparkCognition, and a Vancouver-based agricultural company called Terramera. Only three of his known investments are in Canadian companies.

Mr. Barton has not done anything to neutralize the effect his and his spouse’s mostly foreign financial interests, and his spouse’s work, will have on him as ambassador.

He has placed some investments in a so-called [“blind trust”](http://prciec-rpccie.parl.gc.ca/EN/PublicRegistries/Pages/Declaration.aspx?DeclarationID=c22bc687-e9f0-e911-8107-001dd8b7242d) but he knows what’s in the trust, and he chose and is allowed to give instructions to his trustee. He also has a so-called “[ethics screen](http://prciec-rpccie.parl.gc.ca/EN/PublicRegistries/Pages/Declaration.aspx?DeclarationID=81e51faf-e9f0-e911-8107-001dd8b7242d)” but it doesn’t prohibit him from participating in decisions if “the interest in the decision or matter is of general application.”

Almost all government decisions apply generally to many companies or industry sectors. As a result, Mr. Barton will be allowed to take part in almost all decisions even when he or his spouse or her clients could profit from the decision. His screen is also a smokescreen as it allows him to hide whether he actually removes himself from any decision-making processes.

Instead of his unethical scheme, Mr. Barton should be required to do what [Justice Parker recommended back in 1987](http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/pco-bcp/commissions-ef/parker1987-eng/parker1987-part3-eng.pdf) for all public officials – sell all investments he can sell, and remove himself from all decisions that affect any investments or interests he can’t sell (such as his interest in McKinsey as the former head of the firm, and his spouse’s work interests).

That ethical arrangement would likely mean Mr. Barton would have to remove himself from so many decisions that he wouldn’t be able to do his job.

*“Dominic Barton’s extensive, mainly foreign financial interests conflict with Canada’s best interests, and his so-called blind trust and ethics screen are so full of loopholes they do nothing to prevent him from profiting from his decisions and actions as Canada’s ambassador to China,”* said Duff Conacher, Co-founder of Democracy Watch. *“The federal government should replace him with an experienced foreign service officer who has no financial conflicts of interest.”*

Beyond his investments, [Mr. Barton has also often expressed admiration](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-is-canadas-top-diplomat-still-a-bull-on-china/) for China’s one-party government and its dictatorial President Xi Jinping, going as far as saying he has “drank the Kool-Aid.” He is also [currently defending himself in a lawsuit](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadas-china-ambassador-dominic-barton-to-testify-about-his-mckinsey/) alleging he hid McKinsey’s conflicts of interest when he headed up the firm.

The same loopholes in the *Conflict of Interest Act* that allow Mr. Barton to participate in and profit from his decisions as ambassador in secret allowed Finance Minister Bill Morneau [to propose a bill](https://democracywatch.ca/ethics-commissioner-ruling-exploits-huge-loophole-in-federal-ethics-law-to-let-finance-minister-morneau-off-the-hook-for-clearly-unethical-actions/) that would have profited him and his family’s company. In the past 15 years, these loopholes have allowed about 20 other ministers and top government officials to take part in decisions from which they, their families or friends could profit.

During this minority government, the House Ethics Committee should review the *Conflict of Interest Act* and [MP ethics code](https://www.ourcommons.ca/about/standingorders/appa1-e.htm) ([the last review was in 2013](https://democracywatch.ca/house-committees-must-recommend-that-federal-conflict-of-interest-act-and-mp-and-senate-ethics-codes-and-enforcement-be-changed-in-30-key-ways-to-finally-make-corruption-in-federal-politics-illegal/)), and MPs should [finally close the loopholes](https://democracywatch.ca/how-to-untie-the-unethical-knots-revealed-by-minister-morneaus-scandal/), strengthen enforcement and penalties.

As the Supreme Court of Canada stated [in a 1996 ruling](https://democracywatch.ca/summary-of-supreme-court-of-canada-r-v-hinchey-decision/), to protect our democracy Canadian government officials must be “held to codes of conduct which, for an ordinary person, would be quite severe” to ensure they avoid even the appearance that they are furthering their own or others’ private interests.",ethical investing

ezcfyg,fgmjcc8,unexplodedscotsman,"So it is a surprise that Dominic Barton has been chosen to serve in the high-profile envoy position. After all, Mr. Barton was the global managing director of McKinsey & Co., one of the world’s largest consulting firms, from July, 2009, to September, 2018.

**In December, 2018, The New York Times reported that McKinsey consultants have been heavily involved in advising companies owned by the Chinese state – at least 22 of the 100 biggest ones**, in fact. Just six kilometres away from a lavish corporate retreat held last year in the city of Kashgar, the 2,000-year-old epicentre of Uyghur civilization and culture, more than 120,000 Uyghurs were languishing in camps. And the Times lays out a client list that includes the governments of authoritarian leaders.

As a human-rights activist, I have been focused on Western companies’ direct or indirect involvement in state persecution of Uyghurs. Technological assistance from companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific have helped create the sophisticated high-tech police state that currently exists in Xinjiang, one that reportedly features facial recognition, DNA sequencing, iris scanning and blood sampling. **This has all been under way as McKinsey, which has become highly influential in Eastern Asia in recent years, has been offering its services to the Chinese government.**

Huseyin Celil, a Canadian citizen of Uyghur origin, has been serving a life sentence in China on baseless “terrorism” charges since 2006. And while he was still ambassador, Mr. McCallum helped co-ordinate a letter signed by 14 other Western envoys voicing concern over Uyghur detention, triggering an angry response from Beijing. These are among the files that have been issues for Canada while Mr. Barton was managing partner at McKinsey, a company that said it would not take on jobs that were opposed to its values: “Since 1926,"" the firm said in a statement to the Times, “McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work.” Mr. Barton will now have to deal with these issues head-on in his new role.

This is a moment of crisis around China, one that’s unmatched at any time since 1989. Our new ambassador is expected to help lead new thinking about Canada’s inadequate China policy. Canada needs a new approach in boldly engaging with China to protect our economic priorities, but also to reflect our stake in a rules-based international system that prioritizes human rights and international peace and order.

According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, Mr. Barton’s years of experience in Asia and China, dealing with state-owned big businesses and business elites, make him a great choice to represent Canada and Canadian interests. According to Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, he has been involved in extensive conversations about his role, as well as the importance of human rights and women’s rights.

But given Mr. Barton’s former company’s close engagement with businesses owned by the state that has oppressed our people, Uyghurs have every reason to be nervous about his appointment. Will he be able to separate his established business interests and relationships with Beijing’s elite class from his ambassadorial responsibility to advocate strongly for our Canadian collective interest?

* Quebec's IT integration tax credit (this is becoming a common slush fund); and

3nujab,cvrhv9m,,"I appreciate the effort, that must have taken a long time to compile.

Since I work in healthcare though, I feel it's my obligation to tell you most of what you've written is just false. The articles you've linked to are opinion pieces, and I feel it's extremely disingenuous to cite opinions.

So I'll discuss a few key points. One, we don't have national healthcare. We have public provincial insurance for basic coverage, and that is a large distinction not just me going off on semantics. Provinces receive very little money from the Federal Government that is specific to healthcare. Transfer payment are unconditional; and the provinces use their own set of taxes and investments to fund their healthcare. The national component you and everyone is probably talking about stems from the Canada Health Act. This is a law that states a set of five guidelines that the Provinces need to provide in order to get any assistance. It's *volunteer* only and explicitly does not deal with finances due to constitutional jurisdictions. 

Second, the fear mongering in these opinions is that once we get rid of ""national healthcare"", we're opening up to private healthcare. But we already have that in this country. Whether it's your employer or your union, you most likely have secondary health insurance. 

The problem I have is when we try to politicize our healthcare. It's done by young liberal voters in order to fearmonger their way through an issue. That's not tolerated from other a certain other party and it shouldn't be tolerated here either. The reality of private insurance or even private clinics is that they're already allowed. Quebec in 2005 ruled it was unconstitutional to not allow private clinics. They've seen widespread growth over the past 15 years, long before the Conservatives ever saw a majority government. And they've even been used by ex Prime Ministers (who happened to be a Liberal, no less).

I'm a huge supported of public healthcare and I'm all for having a national component. But please r/Canada quit the fearmongering and quit the *bullshit!* Seriously. It needlessly reduces a complex issue into one that's partisan and drawn across party lines. Since people here are very good at rationalizing bad behaviour if their team does it, I'd rather we didn't politicize healthcare. I don't want to hear ""it's okay when *we* do it"", like the transfer payment cuts in the 90s that reduced healthcare spending in the provinces. We celebrate Martin here everyday for doing that, even if it was terrible for the provinces (some of whom were in a recession at the time) and their ability to pay for healthcare. ",ethical investing

""LOL, the tag lines for the links listed aren't even accurate in that post.

1)
Harper has cut $1.1 billion from Veterans Affairs, despite 40,000 veterans returning home from Afghanistan. The majority of the savings come from veterans’ death and disability compensation. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/.../11.../article21665655/

The very start of the article even says: ""Veterans Affairs Canada has returned $1.13-billion to the federal treasury in unspent funds since the Conservatives came to power in 2006 "". So there were no cuts, there was extra money budgeted that wasn't used. 

In reality: http://www.veterans.gc.ca/.../info-graphics/expenditures
Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) Budget: $2.8B to $3.64B in under 10 years
So since the Conservatives have been in power there has been $4.658.7 billion more spent towards veterans affairs then if it was left at the level of the Liberals funding.

2)
After misleading Canadians to believe F-35 fight jet procurement would cost $9 billion, Conservatives reveal they intend to spend $40 billion on F-35 fighter jet – a jet most experts agree is poorly designed and ill suited for Canadian needs. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/.../budget.../article4104618/ http://www.ctvnews.ca/.../cost-of-buying-servicing-f-35...

From the article: ""Mr. Page's March, 2011 report and its startling conclusion that the plan to buy 65 stealth fighters would cost $29-billion, not the $14.7-billion reported by Defence.""
So the articles that they are referencing have the Conservatives costing at $14.7 billion and the report citing a cost of $29 billion. Yet they claim that the costs were $9 billion and $40 billion, respectively. They can't even copy and paste the correct numbers from their own sources.

Also, the pricing different is mostly related to one item: ""The key difference has been over whether National Defence should have disclosed $10-billion in operating costs for the lifetime of the jets.""
Where the report counts the cost of jet fuel and repairs where the Conservative numbers just talk about the actual cost of buying the planes themselves. So the Liberals aren't even using the same information to get their exaggerated cost predictions.

3)
Haven't seen this one before so would need to look into it before commenting

4)
Harper wanted to join the war in Iraq despite there being no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. This war would later take the country into turmoil after US contracted military firm Blackwater slaughtered innocent Iraqi's in the street, turning a huge portion of the country against US/UK coalition. http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/.../canada-iraq-war_b...

This one is just stupid.  The Liberals were in power in 2003 when the war started and Canadian troops were sent over to Iraq during the Liberals time in power.  So arguing that it is bad for the Conservatives to have supported it when the Liberals supported it as well is completely asinine.

5)
Harper government spends $700,000 fighting disabled veterans in court on benefits after Harper took away life long pension for veterans who have become disabled while fighting for Canada. http://www.cbc.ca/.../disabled-veterans-in-court-fighting... http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/.../veterans-lawsuit-canada...

Again their own articles contradict the point that they are trying to make.  
""In addition to a lump sum injury compensation payment of up to $550,000, the Veterans Affairs website indicates a severely injured soldier with the rank of Major could receive up to $9,685 per month from a variety of government programs.""
So they get $550,000 lump sum and then another $116,220 a year.  The $700,000 spent was in law suits filed against the government that they have to go to court to fight.  Not ones that they filed against the veterans.""",ethical investing

More on economics: 

* the IMF has found that tax increases have little effect on economic growth, while spending cuts do. The takeaway from this is that tax cuts do NOT stimulate the economy, and in fact, have the opposite effect, as they inevitably result in budget cuts. [""A one dollar change in government spending could knock as much as $1.80 in output from the economy – what fund researchers called a “statistically significant…and sizeable"" outcome.""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/05/imf-budget-cuts-hurt-growth-a-lot-but-tax-increases-barely-matter/) The study is [here](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12286.pdf).

* Thatchernomics/Reaganomics/Harpernomics, the idea that if you help the people with money make more money, everyone benefits, has been found to have no basis in reality (again, by the IMF). The opposite, in fact, appears to be true. [""The researchers calculated that when the richest 20% of society increase their income by one percentage point, the annual rate of growth shrinks by nearly 0.1% within five years.""](http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/15/news/economy/trickle-down-theory-wrong-imf/)

""The Seal flights were likely made to coordinate the new smuggling operation from Canada. Mike Huxtable, was helping with the flights through Canada, including both Chapeau airstrip in Quebec and another outside of Weyburn, Saskatchewan. The Weyburn staging area supplied ""protected"" landing strips in Sidney, Chinook, the Fort Peck Reservation, and Havre in Montana. Eventually hundreds of flights were made into Montana bearing billions of dollars worth of cocaine and heroin.""

For starters, your list mostly seems to have been pulled from a Liberal Party critique of Harper's first term.  Because of the bias of the list, not all of the points are valid.  Politics is not my strength, but I was able to spot a few that might be partisanship.

For reference, here is the actual [2006 election platform](https://www.poltext.org/sites/poltext.org/files/plateformes/can2006pc_plt_en._14112008_165519.pdf).  I think that when there is a change in government, there is an optimistic view of how much ""change"" they can implement.  By the second term, there are usually far more achievable goals set.

Moving forward, here is the [2015 election platform](https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf).  As well as the election reform commitment, there are several in there that will only lead to disappointment.  This is not a slight on the current government.

Notice that as soon as the Conservatives gained majority rule, they seemed to fulfill pretty much every promise. Many things cannot be done during a minority rule.

The Liberals have 100% of the power and yet they've broken a huge number of promises compared to the Harper government post 2011. They're not even past the halfway mark through their term either.

onda5,c3illmx,Champ_Sanders,"There seems to be some misinformation about how resources are used in Canada as well as slush funds such as this one.

Canada was designed as a federal state to seperate responsibilities between both levels of government.  This prevents one level from becoming too power and allows for regional interests to be protected. Natural resources are a provincial matter.  Actually interestingly Alberta did not have control of its own resources until the 1930s after oil well after oil had been struck for the first time.

As for Norway's fund there is one in Canada called the Alberta heritage fund which was designed to take all oil income and be used to fund ventures which were too high risk for banks (albertians do not trust banks). It worked incredibly well and at one point in the 70s it was the largest source of liquid capital in the western world.

As with any commodity there are booms and busts and with every drop in the Alberta economy this fund took a hard hit and now i don't there is too much left available.

The Norwegian and alaskian fund fairest much better because they invested heavely outside of the region and were able to weather the drops in oil.

Interestingly the fund was brought in by laugheed PC government in the 70s and before that Ernest Manning believed that oil was a capital commodity extracted from Alberta and the funds should only be used",ethical investing
onda5,c3ily4p,Augustus_Trollus_III,"There are two concepts being thrown about in this thread:

a) a Sovereign wealth fund;  which I'm in favor of,  especially in AB's case

b) Nationalization of AB's OandG; which I am not.

A Sovereign wealth fund ( ie the Heritage fund ),  takes income from the province (royalties etc) and invests them on the open / private markets,  hopefully increasing the wealth of the country / province.    There are plenty of countries doing this ATM,  and benefiting from their market power in doing so.     This way you can increase or decrease royalties as you see fit (as Alberta has done,  and let the private sector do what it does best - exploration and development).  

Nationalizing Alberta's Oil and Gas industry on the other hand,  is an exceptionally bad idea. (and remember,  Alberta makes transfer payments and pays taxes,  so the loss to Alberta is a loss to Canada)  . Also,  some people might argue that the NEP wasn't Nationalization,  but price ceilings.  I would disagree (it was an attempt at least)- see PetroCan and wikipedia below and what their plans were.  

If we look at the NEP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Energy_Program#Alberta_GDP

>It has been estimated by a number of different scholars that **Alberta lost between $50 billion and $100 billion because of the NEP**,[21][22] and that the cost to the average Albertan was about $18,000.[23]


> Given that the program was cancelled in 1986, the NEP was active for five years which are amongst the most expensive for oil prices on record and the NEP prevented Alberta's economy from fully realising those prices.[20]



Any hint of nationalization instantly drives away FDI like oil to water.  Investors do not want to hear 
that word.   If we chose to go that route,  it would be substantially harder to bring back FDI,  since the risks involved have just jumped in the eyes of an investor (nationalization is a huge risk, which
is taken into account when you invest in overseas markets with tin pot dictators etc). 

What's the point in Nationalizing,  if you have complete control of royalties?   If you need more
revenue,  increase them.  It's just that simple.   But don't chase everyone out completely.  That's
stupid. ",ethical investing

There is a high likelihood that when these resources start to run out (i.e.: become energetically too expensive to extract), we won't have much to fall back on except manufacturing (which is rapidly being outsourced), renewables (at least we have forests and the prairies), and high tech (where we need to be investing much, much more).

The economy of Norway does so well and has grown so fast because of oil, so their energy policies have to reflect that - when they run out of oil, they will NEED those savings to maintain consumption for a reasonable amount of time.

Maybe they're necessary in someone's real world if they are large elements of that person's life - like programming, gardening, plumbing, etc. - but many people don't partake in such things. After all, plumbers here have to go to college too (not university, but college, which is like community college/trade school), so obviously they don't expect everyone to have that skill.

Not everyone plays sports, not everyone understands even basic scientific ideas (I certainly do not, as a PhD student I'd fail a high school science class), and not everyone is entrepreneurial. Your list is less of a necessary life skills list, and more of a list that can make graduates (or current students) feel like they're inadequate.",ethical investing
6wx27a,dmc1voe,theuniquenerd,"the essential skills upon graduating are:

* interviewing skills

* time/money budgeting skills

* public speaking

* writing skills

anything else is not necessary to be expert in knowledge on, just the basics Wikipedia version is fine.

I went and commented on each of the fields you named with justifications/advice on each, just to improve on your list, as I'm in the real world *now* and think I can offer some insight.

* Dating Skills: any more than basics isn't required mastery. you don't need to be a pick up line stud. you'll find someone out there that will match you just fine without being super suave.

* Formal & Informal Conversational Skills: rename this to professional conversational skills. you already know how to talk to a wall aka ""informal"" skills (I'd hope). what you should work on is how to talk about your field in a poignant and concise yet professional manner. you're abilities and ideas mean *nothing* if you don't know how to express them.

* Public Speaking: absolutely positively. join a toastmasters club. I did for a few months and it was the absolute best thing I could've done with my time. I learned how to talk, how to present myself, and how to express my ideas into words. like before, you're abilities and ideas mean **nothing** if you don't know how to express them.

* Reading Skills(Habit): this is hard. some people like to read, some people don't. the skill develops over time, when you have time. out in the real world working 55 hours a week, I'd be lucky to read something, anything, but if I can, I read, if not, it's video game subtitles. hey, it still counts as reading.

* Basic Knowledge about tools: buy drawer piece of ikea furniture, assemble it. bam, basic knowledge learned for <$100

* A programming language: not super important unless you're in the computer field. just a Wikipedia about Java, HTML, VBA is about the most you need.

* Gardening/Agriculture: water it, don't over water it. looks/feels dry, water it, looks/feels wet, don't water it. looks dead water it. needs sun just like you. lights in an office does not = sunlight. boom all the knowledge you need.

* Lumbering/Plumbing: useful skill. lots of youtube videos on it. I fixed my toilet the other day from a youtube video. try and find one on disconnecting and reconnecting the plug in your bathroom sink. lumbering is hard, requires a lot of tools. see if there's a carpentry class somewhere near you, I did it, it's fun. I'm actually quite good at it. kind of wish I became a carpenter instead of a sassy squid lord. if no classes are around or cheap enough, assembling an ikea furniture piece will do the good for lumbering skills and assembling stuff.

* Finances, Economics and Investments: whohoahoahaoh yup so important. look at fidelity, Edward jones, /r/personalfinance. make a budget. just sit down, and make a damn budget for yourself. my god. it helps so friggin much.

* Sex Ed: after covering with a thin clear tarp, rod a goes into slot b. boom *learned*

* One foreign language: you *should* learn this as a requirement for your undergrad degree, if not, pick up german. super fun language, a lot like English. really impresses people with not much effort.

* How to write Mails, Notes, Short Stories etc: ding ding. must learn how to write! even if it's a short journal entry, learning how to express yourself is so SO important. easy tip is to get some field notes books, make them into journals, and practice journaling. my god does it make you a good writer. I do a lot of writing just for fun, and it's amazing. I seriously just finished writing my own memoir last week, working on writing another book something now, I love writing. absolutely learn to love writing, since most people hate it, and you'll be highly valued for your writing skills in the workplace.

* Office Ethics: keep your mouth shut, do what your supervisor says, head down, work hard, it'll take you far. 0 to supervisor in 4 years is absolutely possible, I'm living proof.

* Table Manners: chew with your mouth closed. you didn't grow up in a barn, be polite dang it. boom *learned*

* Power Structures and their working: tf...is this. please explain. I am so confused? voltron assemble?

* Politics and Diplomacy: if you're not lookin to join this field as a career, don't worry about it, most of it is out of your control. watch some khan academy vids on civics, read some Wikipedia on it, besides that, you pay taxes so you don't need to worry about this too much.

* Etiquette(Dressing, composing oneself, etc): don't be a mess, dress to impress, wear bow ties/ties people notice. you'll get promoted faster than the guy that shows up in beanies, and sweatshirts. I wear a blazer everyday at my desk, and always act like a professional. just don't be weird. boom *learned*

* One Musical Instrument: kazoo, or the triangle, or the theremin. either or as a skill on a resume, employers will ask ""tf is a theremin?"" explain it, and you'll seem super smart for knowing how to wave your damn hands in the air to make noises like an alien. boom **advice** *yo*

* Salesmanship(How to sell oneself): sosososososoosoooooooo important. resumes are you on paper, but then for interviews, you have to be better than on paper. whoever of you thought of this, deserves a nice...something nice. I'm way more likely to hire someone that has personality as well as the work ethic, than is literally just a seat in a desk to do work like a mindless zombie. learn this by interacting with your professors, surprisingly enough, they will treat you like adults if you treat them like professionals and with respect, you learn how to sell your skills and your abilities to one person, you can do it again.

* Color Schemes: some colors match, some *absolutely* don't. this isn't 1972. go to home depot/lowes look at all the paint color swatches. look at logos, see what looks pretty. colors, wow.

* Entrepreneurship: it's expensive and requires a lot of capital. only do it if it's your absolute passion or you're rich. it's hard and tough work. simple Wikipedia on certain things make sense, or just watching shows like kitchen nightmares, people run out of cash, get in the hole, and it's pretty much like that for every single business.

* How to raise a kid: the definitive ""how to"" is never complete, ask any parent, especially my mother, I'm still teaching her how to parent properly 27 years later.

* Basic Scientific Ideas: mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, e=mc^2, look it burns because it's burnable. your knowledge of high school science is enough to get by.

* At least one sport: Indoor & Outdoor : running, working out is a sport right? learn a thing that makes you get your heart rate up. even if it is giant inflatable dragon riding related. it counts!

* Time management: so important. keep a calendar, a good calendar, not a shit one. anything else more than this is somewhat overkill. learn to budget your time as well as you budget your money.

* Leadership experience: the workplace teaches this best, as does learning public speaking skills believe it or not. nothing can really prepare you for the ""actualness"" of what leadership roles you'll need in your environment until you're in the real world itself.

* Cooking: boil water, pudding does not belong on the stove, ramen noodles. if you can make 1 ramen noodle dish with chicken from stratch, you're fine. more important imo is baking. learning how to follow directions. it's all from experience, bake and cook as much as you can aka 1 time a week at least.

* How to operate electronics and computers: you're on reddit, can type in a word doc, know how to use excel, powerpoint? then you have more skills than most, and are considered smart. best skill is being able to use google like a champ. just google stuff, Wikipedia stuff, read as much as you can.

* Dance: get a copy of just dance, play it daily for 3 months, learn the choreography to popular songs from the game, bam, you have dance skills.

>On, October 2009, Collins compared New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (who is Jewish) to Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, and the antichrist. Collins later apologized for his comments.[87]


>On February 10, 2017, Collins told Chris Cuomo on CNN's New Day that elected officials should not have to release their respective tax histories. This comment was made in response to the ongoing controversy concerning Trump's refusal to release his tax forms.[89]



_________

>In August 2016, Collins became the largest shareholder in a company called Innate Immunotherapeutics.[93] In May 2017, House ethics investigators ""began probing Collins for his role in recruiting investors to buy stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics after several complaints were filed.""[94] Members of Congress are explicitly barred from trading stocks using insider information.[94] In October 2017, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) said they had ""substantial reason"" to believe that Collins had improperly used his public office to benefit Innate, and had forwarded nonpublic information to other investors.[95] The OCE said Collins sent nonpublic information to investors about drug trials and that he visited the National Institutes of Health to discuss a drug's clinical trial, violating House ethics rules.[95] The House Ethics Committee did not appoint a subcommittee to continue investigating Collins' case.[96] On August 8, 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court on Collins and two other defendants for ""illegal insider trading"".[97]
_______

**Arrest**

>According to the federal government, on June 22, 2017, the CEO of Innate Immunotherapeutics sent an email to the company's board of directors, including Collins. The e-mail explained that an important drug trial for the company had failed. Collins allegedly received this news while attending a picnic at the White House and, upon seeing the email, immediately phoned his son and instructed him to sell shares in the company. According to the allegations, the sale allowed Collins and his family to avoid around $570,000 in losses. The shares eventually dropped around 90% once news about the drug trial became public.[66]

>On August 8, 2018, Collins, his son Cameron, and the father of Cameron's fiancée, Stephen Zarsky, were arrested by the FBI and charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, and lying to the FBI.[64][65][98] Later that day, Speaker of the US House of Representatives Paul Ryan announced that he had removed Collins from his position on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He also referred the matter to the House Ethics Committee.[64][66][99]


____________

**Resignation from Congress and guilty plea**
>On September 30, 2019, it was reported that Collins would change his plea to guilty.[100] and resign his seat in the House on October 1, 2019.[101][102] His resignation, which was previously presented to the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, became official on October 1 after it was presented on the floor of the US House of Representatives.[4] The same day, Collins traveled to a Manhattan federal courthouse and pleaded guilty to insider trading and lying to the FBI.[2][3]

>On December 9, 2019, Collins and the SEC agreed that Collins will ""be permanently barred from acting as an officer or director of any public company"".[103] In January 2020, federal prosecutors recommended that Collins receive the maximum prison sentence, nearly five years in prison.[104]",ethical investing

I'm going to take a stab at an edit so here goes:

>~~I’ve had the desire to create since childhood. The first job I wanted to have as a child was a fashion designer and if you were to tell seven-year-old (my name) that she wouldn’t grow up to be the next Karl Lagerfeld, she’d be absolutely crushed. Anytime we’d visit Wal-Mart, I would beg my parents for things like acrylic paint, sewing patterns and anything else I thought would help me be the fashion designer I knew I was meant to be. My room quickly became a large collage of all of my “creations”. It was stained with the odd color scheme of purple and green from the acrylic paints I successfully begged for and I couldn’t be happier. I even customized my own jeans with those same paints, beaded fringe and just about anything else that was small enough to be sewn on. I envisioned what my runway shows would look like and even the names of each collection I would release. But what I didn’t envision was how my desire to create would completely change throughout my life.~~ **Nix this entire thing. You're applying to a Communication program, not a Fashion one**  
>  
>I like to think that the communication profession chose me from an early age. Starting in middle school, I realized that I was often tasked with organizing events for the clubs I took part in. I quickly learned that successfully pulling off an event is an art form of its own but it wasn’t until college that I felt a true sense of belonging in this field.   
>  
>Throughout my undergraduate career, I had the privilege of working with many non-profit organizations and small businesses. (**How so? What projects?

I really hope my edits weren't off putting. Writing these things is tough but you need to sell yourself, your skills, and your qualifications. Here, you're selling your *feelings* and it does not make you come across as someone who is primed for success in the program. 

Avoid the passive voice (""could potentially transform"",  ""desire to create then started to shift"", etc.). Use forceful and definitive wording - I know nothing about your background, they won't either so it's on you to spell out exactly what qualifications and experiences you have. Watch for unnecessary commas and don't use cliches!

If you're comfortable learning how and when to use colons, semicolons, or hyphens then use them - they're great tools to change up the flow when used properly. However, do not use them if you aren't 100% sure. Misusing them will set you up for failure quicker than leaving them out entirely.

Likewise, vary the length of sentences throughout paragraphs. Short sentence here. Then maybe put a medium length sentence right after it. You could even go all out and throw in a much longer sentence in the paragraph, especially when you are using it to emphasize a point. You have options.  

And above all, SELLLLLLL YOURSELF! What specialized classes did you take? What internships or projects did you work on? What did you do in your free time that helps you stay competitive? What about any special software or media? Be specific!",ethical investing
flnatq,fl1kd3y,Grevious47,"Hmm, coming from a STEM field I might be giving advice from a perspective that isn't relevant but I'll take a crack at it.

Your first paragraph, to  me, feels out of place and a bit pointless.  I'm not sure that a graduate program is going to care that you liked playing dressup as a kid...especially given the graduate program isn't for fashion.

It makes the first sentence of your second paragraph absolutely jarring.  You talk about dresses, and paint and fashion and then you say ""it feels like communication chose me"".  What?  Why?  What in your previous statement suggests that communication chose you....you made it sound like you were drawn to fashion.  The name you dropped was a famous fashion designer, at no point do you mention someone who is in actual communications that you aspire to.  Honestly in my opinion scrap the first paragraph, come up with a new one that actually leads into the statement ""it feels like communication chose me"".

In a way I feel like your second paragraph more justifies that statement, but then that statement should come at the end of the second paragraph, not the beginning.  Honestly though I'd just drop that statement that ""communication chose you"" entirely, having your career path be ""fated"" just sounds hokey to me.

I think your description of your developing interest in communications and why you consider it valuable and how you want to learn more to be able to help contribute and improve your community is all good and that should be the start of and the focus of your statement.

Your statement about the Universities Madrid campus comes completely out of no where and does not mesh up at all with the rest of what you said. You want to focus on developing your profeessional skills in communication and you chose this University due to its proximity and involvement in BOSTON and yet almost immediately afterwords you say that a draw for you would be the ability to leave and go to Madrid.  Just drop that statement it makes it sound like you like the idea of a free vacation because you say nothing that suggests why you would consider Madrid important to your professional development.

So yeah.  Drop the first paragraph, drop the first sentence of the second paragraph, flesh out more how you became interested in communication and what you want your future career to be and how this specific University fits your needs.

"" I am choosing to apply to Suffolk University because I realized that there couldn’t be a better communication program or university for me elsewhere. ""

Really?  That is why you are applying to this University...it is literally the best University and program you can possibly attend?  This statement just seems a bit overdramatic and frankly made me immediately skeptical.  Not sure it adds anything, I'd drop it.

""  I worked very hard obtaining my bachelor’s degree at (my undergrad university) and I’ve made a commitment to myself and my family to bring the same work ethic to Suffolk University. ""

Drop this too.  Who wouldn't say this?  This is just a given, if you are going to a graduate program you are making a commitment to work hard and if they accept you its because you worked hard at your undergrad.  Just saying ""pick me, I work hard"" just seems like you don't have anything to say.  Honestly you might just drop the entire last paragraph, seems unnecessary.

Finally I noticed that you don't seem to reference any work or real-world experience in any detail when it comes to communications except for in a really vague ""I worked for a non-profit"" statement.  Honestly besides a one paragraph intro statement your actual experience should be the focus. You mention the value of non-profits...maybe spend some time giving specifics of the projects you contributed to and how you were involved...without any detail for all the reader knows you volunteered for one month and opened mail. Saying you were ""given the opportunity"" to do something makes it sound like you didn't do anything.

99ec65,e4nnzlm,starsandstufff,"Came here thinking this would be an encouraging post for grad students.....what a rollercoaster post. Sorry you've had the shittiest time in grad school, OP. While I agree that \*some\* supervisors are what you've described, it is wildly unfair to say that all (or even most) are like that. For any grad students reading this post and getting anxious, here is some alternative input:

>Don't get too friendly too soon with other grad students

100000% disagree. It's good to network with your fellow students. You don't have to be friends outside of school, but it's nice to have friendly faces to chat with in your cohort. Lots of grad students share office spaces, so being friendly is really important for a positive space to exist. 

>They are often extremely flawed and insecure people who aren't that invested in you beyond getting you out their door so they can work on their own publications.

I have no idea what supervisors you've had, but I cannot begin to describe how far from the truth this is. Yes, some shitty supervisors exist. But, \*a lot\* of good ones are out there too. I know a lot of supervisors who are personally invested in their students' wellbeing and success. For example, my MA supervisor offered to help me move apartments one semester after a really stressful battle with my landlords. Her and her husband came to my place and spent the afternoon helping me move. She offered without even hesitating, like it was the most normal thing in the world. I know **many** supervisors like her, across disciplines.

>They will always side with the department chair,

No. Absolutely not. They will not \*always\* side with the chair. My supervisors often challenged the hair if they believed there was cause. For the most part, department chairs at my institutions are very agreeable people, and there's often not much reason to challenge them. More broadly, departmental politics are not as clear-cut/black and white as some folks think. Sometimes there are other things going on that place your supervisor in a difficult position with regard to challenging a head. 

>If you aren't brown, your complaints will be perceived as just a trouble maker, no matter how valid and legit.

Clarify please? I'm genuinely curious what you mean by this. 

>Focus on building relationships with students if you are assigned to teach

Absolutely agree. TA's often aren't encouraged enough to do this. It's important to build those connections with students because that sill will carry into the rest of your career. 

>It will reap large benefits for you and will ultimately speak much more to your legacy than a letter from one of the many self-absorbed and narcissistic professors

As mentioned above, I agree that learning how to foster relationships and connections with students will benefit your career as a whole. BUT, a good reference letter is one of the most important things in an application. Whether you like it or not, it is. A well-written reference letter is one of the best things your application can include because it  is a chance for an advisor, committee member, professor, or employer of yours to boast about why you're an excellent fit for whatever you're applying for. It is extremely valuable in supporting your personal statement/statement of interest or cover letter.

2banmm,cj3qgqx,adamaa,"One suggestion, one addition.

 First, undergraduate research experiences are incredibly important for people to pursue. Though you will not be judged on the merit of your research, in my experience REU programs guarantee you a letter of recommendation *that compare you to student from other universities.* Letters of recommendation from your home institution only serve to compare you to a small pool (unless you're already at a Top 20 school).

Second, graduate schools look to see that you took and succeeded in graduate courses (this means courses using graduate-level textbooks). Straight A's in only undergraduate course work will mean less than A-/B+ course work in graduate level material.

Sincerely, a pure mathematician.    ",ethical investing
2banmm,cj3rt5k,smilingkiwi,"I think that everyone coming from an American university in my applied math cohort had at least a summer of research, many had more (it's different for international students.) Research experience can balance out a lower GPA, at least at my school, and it's also really important for fellowship applications.

The GRE isn't really considered, as long as you did decently (this includes the subject GRE.) ",ethical investing
2banmm,cj4dbjf,Itsalrightwithme,"I think there are several very good questions that can be addressed together, namely questions along the lines of, ""I don't have any research papers, am I screwed?"" and, ""Does my 5 years of industry work experience count for anything at all?"" 

To answer these questions, let's work things out backwards. What does it take to earn a PhD, and to be precise let's consider the North American PhD model (since there are differences around the world). In North America, a PhD is awarded for **novel contribution to research**. 

Along the way, what does it take to earn a PhD after you are admitted to the program, beyond staying out of academic probation? 

1. You need to do well in some coursework, as required. You may need a minor, yadayadayada. 

2. You have to pass a PhD quals exam, different departments have different systems. 

3. You need a PhD supervisor. 

4. You have to form a thesis committee. 

5. Your supervisor and committee have to approve a thesis proposal.

6. You have to do the research.

7. You have to write a thesis, and yes, you need a **thesis**, as in, an argument that captures your contribution.

8. You have to defend your thesis. 

So along the way, the way research are done can be very different across disciplines. 

More theoretical -> more background reading, testing hypothesis, consulting with experts, re-forming hypothesis, etc. Clearly there is higher threshold to be met to ""publication"", that's why Math PhD grads regularly finish with very few papers unless you are computationally-oriented, which makes you more similar to an experiment-oriented PhD. Hence in theoretical areas they have to rely on grades, LoR. 

More applied -> getting involved in projects, perhaps supporting more senior students, perhaps supporting existing experiments, or perhaps working your way up to a leadership position in aspects of a project. So your work experience can be very important in demonstrating you can give value to the projects as you pursue a PhD. 

In all the steps I listed above, the admission committee will assess your fitness in completing all the steps. 

Example: Poor grades -> risk of not passing classes, which is step 1. And also risk of not passing quals, which is step 2. Poor LoR may suggest risk of not being able to find a supervisor, or to form a committee. No research experience means risk of not being able to write a good research proposal. 

In certain areas of course it's hard to expect ugrads to have publications. Then the admission committee will put their effort on other possible evidence of PhD potential. Namely, LoR prestige and strength, GPA, test scores, etc. 

Anyway, hope this helps a bit. ",ethical investing

720qb7,dnf04j8,doobeedoo3,"I think there are two questions here. The first is whether graduate school is worth paying for, and the second is whether graduate school is the best investment of your inheritance. 

For #1: yes, grad school is worth paying for if it's a vocational or professional program where you stand to recoup your investment, or if you are paying affordable tuition for a program that you find personally enriching. Some jobs are happy with any advanced degree to fulfill a graduate training requirement. 

For #2: inheriting a windfall presents a complex question in any scenario. Should you invest it? Spend it? Save it? Considering that you're probably not going to be in this situation again, I'd say you should do something with the money that would take a lot of time and work to do otherwise. (Also, just anecdotally, I find people work harder when grad school isn't a free ride.)

Graduate school is something you can pay for via scholarships, assistantships, or working a job that pays for you to attend school. You can also take out loans if you want. Again, #1 applies here: don't overspend, consider your ROI. Personally, I'd say to consider investing this money. Few investments are 100% guaranteed to grow your money, but grad school is *definitely* not guaranteed to grow your money. Consider something like a down payment on a house or apartment.

If you're independently wealthy (aka situation 1), sure - go forth and do whatever the fuck you want. If you just have a nice nest egg but will need to earn a salary to live, I'd approach grad school with at least some pecuniary aspect in mind. Times/fortunes change and a couple hundred thousand isn't a lot of money at all in the grand scheme of things. You can use it to make a wise investment, like a downpayment on a house where you plan to live or a flat in a metro area that you rent out, but grad school is not a solid investment of your money. Not unless it's something like finance and you have a strong record of success in it already. If you're interested in business, that's solid start-up capital to begin a venture of your own.

I also would like to add something. This post apparently focuses on how young age is not (necessarily) a downside and doesn't matter all that much. But how about it also being a straight **upside** in some cases? There are unquestionable advantages in having experience, but remember that younger people are statistically more prone to take risks, which is something appreciated in the startup world.  
As much as experience helps, it also makes us biased towards, well, our own experience, which might not always represent the whole picture. I've seen multiple times how a newcomer — and *especially* the youngest person in the team — will be one to question every ""we have always done it this way"", raising legitimate concerns everyone else got insensitive to.  


While age isn't a downside, I wouldn't say it doesn't matter — rather that it comes with its own set of pros and cons. The youngest guy in our team — still in college — is one to come up with the bravest and freshest ideas, along with unmatched enthusiasm when it comes to coding :) quite a difference as compared with the caution I brought along from working in a large enterprise software company.",ethical investing

cgvt6l,eulp2nr,burbabull,"Hey, I was in a similar position about 16 months ago. Here's the advice I wish I'd listened to:

1. Pitch decks don't get funded - teams do. A team of one (student?) is a hard sell. Building the business is MUCH harder.
2. Working alone is SLOW, and a company is far more than it's product. Imagine yourself in 6 months, mvp ""done"", working on marketing, messaging, advertising, fundraising, customer support, and feature development. The analogy is playing ""whack a mole"". While you work on one problem, the rest are all neglected. Growing the business is MUCH harder.
3. Staying motivated is hard, especially in the face of disappointing growth numbers. We all want to see that ""hockey stick"" curve of users, but when it's not happening, who'll keep your head up? Commitment is MUCH harder.

I followed exactly the same thought pattern as you. Control is great - you make the decisions, there's no one to convince. That's also a massive drawback - you build conviction and refine ideas by convincing others. If I could do this again, I'd happily give up 25+% interest in my company to a dedicated co-founder.

It looks like you've given this a lot of thought. It's terrifying, stressful, ""anxiogenic"", no doubt. But I'd rather risk idea theft and conflict than plug away at an app for 2 years before throwing in the towel.

I strongly recommend against using your desktop computer as the back end server. AWS often gives credits to startups, you could try that.

I would start with AWS free tier anyway even if you can't get free credits, there are a lot of potential issues using your home network for production workloads like this, especially if you don't have an IT background. Security is a huge concern there, as are things like backup and availability.

you'll have 9 months in to developing an app before anyone else sees it.

those two things mean you are doing it wrong.

4 years ago I wasn't a good programmer - but I was an alright one - 15+ years in tech, and I pick things up *very* fast - I decided I'd found a niche and started working on an app - I convinced a programmer friend to join me - I laid out a feature that I figured would take me a month to make. He had what he called a ""rough cut"" back to me the next day - his rough cut was better than my finished product would have been - a few subtleties and tweaks aside - it was amazing.

As others have said - it's all about a team - and you quickly realize that you need other people to complement your skills - you *need* a team - even if it's a small one. You can do things faster than they can and they can do things faster than you.

A team needs to be more than the sum of it's parts - but when it is - the results can be amazing.

New people also bring new ideas - not all of them will be great - and you'll spend a lot of time answering stupid questions initially - but as people get comfortable in the space they'll probably come up with amazing ideas that you'd never thought of.

You can't do everything yourself - you need people to help you - the sooner you bring them in the faster you can get them up to speed. Ideally you need a team that can handle most/all of the 'stuff' and you spend your time working on the team and guiding them towards the vision rather than working on the work. If you try to do everything you'll end up focused on the wrong thing most of the time because you don't have enough time to stop and reflect and focus on what will really move the needle.

2. Are you convinced about the product? Don't give a fuck about the market! For all good products, the market never existed, they came and built the market by themselves.

If I were you, I wouldn't treat this as a super serious project but as a hobby. You're constantly learning, if you want to pivot you have most of the codebase ready that you own and so on.

Cut down on amount of features. MVP shouldn't take 9-12 months to make, it should take closer to 2 weeks. It is understandable if you're not experienced and it takes longer, but you really should focus on the bare minimum to make it barely work.

While testing product fit, researching the market etc. is important for non-technical founders, as a technical founder you should focus on shitting out MVP's on a regular basis. Everything is so much easier when you have an MVP in your hands and investors will gladly help you out with the non-technical side.

When you have an MVP that people like, you'll get a queue of people that will pay you for the chance of being your cofounder and doing all the other stuff. 

Focus on the technical side. Throw lot of shit at a wall and something will stick. Do note that only PUBLISHED things matter.

I am an MBA and started a company with an attorney co-founder. We had attracted some attention from major angels in the start up scene and were on the verge of a round from a top tier VC. I was the biz. dev. guy and he was the 'attorney'. I had similar issues with ethically questionable numbers were put in front of VCs / investors to complete the round. I didn't raise a large enough flag protesting those numbers because I assumed he had done his homework and I trusted him. Unfortunately or fortunately, the numbers didn't pass the due diligence and some of the investors retreated. Some investors that truly understood the industry, lurked around to see if we can actually show the impact. I stayed another few months after but this 'itch' just kept getting stronger. I quit, let go of my unvested stock and just folded it in. X years later now, they are still in business but no longer the trajectory that they were capable of.

&#x200B;

A few things about your situation, now that I am a few years away from the experience:

1. If he is doing this now, he will do it again. Imagine what the 'success' of raising the round will do to egos around you. It will become validation for this type of behavior moving forward. Your subsequent rounds will likely not pass the due diligence and by then you've been party to this 'fraud'.
2. You mention you have two other Co founders. If you can't get them to support your concerns on this, you've got the wrong team around you. 
3. The idea that employees will support you (vs. him). Great - they probably see what you see as well. One of the lead guys doing ethically questionable stuff just sets the wrong precedent.
4. Investors.  You're saying that investors will support you. Are any of them the angel type (vs. VC) that you can envision bringing on your board? The reason I ask is that, this is the type of person (whether they are or not on you board) can give you the right advise. Be open to them about your concern. Are you fears valid? Are you overreacting? Is this normal? 

  
I don't know you or yours skills, but it does seem like you've got leadership characteristics that make people like you (investors and employees). Don't compromise on your ethics or turn a blind eye. This journey is a marathon and not just about getting that next round.

You as a business owner are not obligated to price your services as cheaply as possible to the benefit of your customers.  You are free to set whatever price you can get away.

If you are adding a lot of value to your customers and they are willing to pay more than you initially believed, it's fair game to raise the price (within contractual limits).

8ouf0q,e07vao8,Mortdeus,"I used to think this was a concern until I realized that it's pretty stupid. 

The thing about ideas is that they are worthless and there is no telling whether they will be extremely valuable when they are actually something. Something that seems revolutionary and capable of changing the entire world in your head, is more than likely something that is going to ultimately end up being a failure to launch. 

That's just how the market works. And the thing is, if you're idea is truly a crazy idea. (like AirBNB) and you have the concept ironed out, patented, trademarks filed etc. Then you have nothing to worry about if you send the pitch deck out. 

If they rip you off and that company makes a billion dollar startup that  is about to be acquired or IPO, then you have just been put into the ultimate negotiation position because if you file a lawsuit against them at that time, you could absolutely quash the startup's founders' and investors' chance at a fat payday if you have a very ironclad case. 

Typically in this kind of situation you will be given a founder sized chunk of the pie so that you get a fat paycheck too. And best of all, you didn't have to put in ANY work. That mean's that you didn't have to put in the work making the successful product. But that also means you didn't have to work on a product that could have more than likely ended up being a complete waste of time. 

Top tier VCs just aren't willing to take that kind of a risk because in that situation they have laid their reputation totally in your hands. VCs wouldn't survive very long if they were in the business of taking somebody else's idea and trying to run with them. 

I mean considering the fact that you aren't the first person to trip out about this kind of thing, i'd be wary of being a VC like Y Combinator who receives a stupid number of pitches each funding cycle, and trying to discern which ideas they were pitched that sounded awful a couple of years ago, but now all of a sudden sound feasible since the market changed. 

Like if you pitched the idea of making a blockchain based website 8 years ago, you'd probably get shot down. Nowadays, that same idea would probably make a resurgence. 

However, the thing is people with an idea like that, will often resubmit their idea or go ahead and try to build it without funding, or find funding else where, etc.

In series A/B/C or in acquisition talks, people will often engage with your company under the premise of investing or buying, but what they're really after is information on your business model, processes, customer base, etc..  Frequently you'll find people trying to pump you for info and then walk away.

In business, you'll frequently go through very long sales engagements where someone strings you along with the promise of a signature if they just get a little more information from you.  And instead once they get all the info they can on your product, they send it to a preferred vendor or they try to in-house build it for cheaper.

Etc..  Its all unethical.  But it happens a LOT, in all facets of business not just the early startup stage.  You have to learn to trust your gut on certain things and when you feel like you're spending too much time or giving up too much info to someone, create hoops for them to jump through.

However, it's a bit surprising to see someone give up because an accelerator alum got their business plan. Was the other team really THAT far ahead of you after coming out of an accelerator? They probably have $250-500k behind them, probably blew it if they're struggling hard enough to steal someone's idea, and have a bit of training from an accelerator. Is this REALLY an idea whose market can only be served by one company?

As a sector-specific VC, (regional, not in the Valley, so i don't need to act like that) I see the same idea presented probably once a quarter. Most of the time, there's room for multiple of these companies to be successful simultaneously at any scale, from the sub-$100mm strategic acquisition to the unicorn IPO. That's just my experience. Unfortunately, I also have the experience of entrepreneurs not taking 5 minutes to look at my portfolio (which is freely available on my website, as with most VCs) before sending me a pitch deck unsolicited for their company, which competes with my own portfolio company. Am I going to steal their idea? No, I believe my company is better, otherwise I wouldn't have funded it. Would I give their idea to a floundering company of my own? Hell no, if one of my companies is on the ropes, my money is better spent on the jockeys that have proven they can succeed. Am I going to take a long look at their performance, their successes and failures, and their competition section? You bet your ass.

To be clear, I'm not defending this accelerator's actions. That shit gets around and always comes back to bite you in the end (unless everyone keeps it to themselves when they've been robbed).

I have a question regarding compensation as an employee who has taken on many different responsibilities over the course of 2 years without a raise/equity bump. Here's some background:

I came on as employee #4, first non-engineer, as a User Operations Specialist in the bay area about ~22 months ago. During salary negotiations, I was told that we would review compensation and look to increase it again if we raise additional capital (CEO estimated we'd raise capital within 6 months, but that didn't pan out). I understood that the pay wouldn't be market rate and I ended up with a $70k ($15k below market rate) and 0.33% equity, medical/dental/vision (no 401k, or any other benefits).

Employee #5 was hired at the same time, same role, but left after about a year. I took on the extra responsibilities without asking for a raise because I wanted to prove to the founder that I was serious about growing the company and product. I also thought that a raise would be out of the question since we were still running on seed funding. It made sense to just keep working.

I'm approaching 2 years at the start up and my responsibilities have changed similar to those of a product manager's. Our team has not grown and it was announced that we received bridge capital to hire more engineers (not a series A) so I know we now have additional funding...

I love working with my team and absolutely believe in the vision, product, and goals. My input is valued and I'm able to contribute my ideas and touch a lot of the product.

How should I go about asking for a raise in the company’s current state? Where do I stand for negotiations? Am I justified for a raise?

Given them investor updates and maybe observer rights but if they don't normally do startups, don't give them any legal rights beyond that of a stockholder (or preferred stockholder).  Case in point, this guy sounds like an idiot.  It sounds like he's cutting off his nose to spite his face -- he's ruining a chance to get a great return off this investment for some short-sighted gain.  I've seen so many clowns give money to startups and start asking for things that are just ridiculous.  This also results in the unfortunate situation of making your company much less attractive to future sophisticated investors.

Good luck, I hope you're able to come out of this with some positive resolution.

I don't want to file for a patent, because the reasoning to do some seems mostly frivolous. The only reason I may file for a patent is to remove the friction from the fundraising process - to check the ""box"" if you will. As much as I want to be a champion against the requirement for entrepreneurs to file for IP as a prereq to raising money - it's not my battle to fight.

In my area, investors for tech companies are scarce and inherently conservative. It's your typical herd mentality who all require the same boxes be checked. I actually did tell a local vc that a patent would be a waste, and their response was 'not for us, it's protection for our money'.

3mcaq5,cvdx2vl,itk_apparel,">A few arguments against startups filing for patents:

>* They cost $10-$15k a pop, and can soak up a significant amount of your CTO's time, often at a critical early phase of the company.

Good argument, but they need to decide if it's worth the time and money.

>* You don't even get them for several years, by which time your startup has probably either succeeded or failed, and these patents will have played no part in it either way (except perhaps for the previous point where they probably hurt you by sapping money and time).

They are often used for marketing once they're filed and still pending, which can help you succeed.

>* US jurisprudence has been increasingly restricting what can be patented over the past few years. What was clearly patentable 3 years ago is clearly unpatentable today, so there is a pretty good chance that your patents will be rejected. In particular, business method patents are no-longer being granted.

Your attorney will help decide this, so you won't waste too much time or money if they don't think it's patentable. This will also lower your chance of rejection if they think it's a good idea.

>* Even if you don't have a problem with patents covering a real innovation, these are not the kind of patents most patent lawyers will want you to file for. Firstly because they will require a lot more work to create (and you're only paying them $10-15k). And secondly, because they tend to be specific enough that they're less useful as an offensive weapon.

Plenty of tech patents get submitted by law firms. Firms charge by the hour, regardless if it's 1k or 50k.

Patents are written to be as broad as they can be.

>* Even if the patents do cover a real innovation, if it's granted you've now disclosed something valuable to your competitors. They may not be able to copy it directly, but as you know there are typically many ways to solve any given problem in computer science, and now they know how you solved it.

True, but you also try to consider these workarounds and include them in your patents.

>* Even if they're granted, their only real value will be as part of a firesale in the event of your company's failure, where they'll probably be snapped up by a patent troll for less than you paid to file for the patent in the first place.

Their value is an investment in your business to help it succeed, which isn't usually measurable.

>When people ask about my ""IP defensibility"" strategy, I generally argue for trade secrets. They're free, require no effort, you're not disclosing potentially important information to competitors, and they basically lack any of the other shortcomings I describe above.

This is true, except most tech trade secrets can be figured out from the end result. Algorithms can be replicated for the most part, UIs can be recreated, etc. The patent is intended to scare people off from doing this and protecting you for a period of time if you're first to market with something truly novel.

A real negative is the cost of enforcing your patent in court if you need to. A patent is useless if you don't have the funds to back it up if the defendant blows off your cease and desist.

Also patents get published years before they're granted or rejected unless you pay more to not publish them.

If you find the right people to work with, they can dramatically reduce the amount of time required from your CTO.

My startup has three patents pending. You could argue they aren't worth the money. Certainly we have little to no intention to litigate on them until we get bigger. The value of a patent is not litigation, it's licensing.

It depends on what type of company you are. If you are building an app, chances are you don't need patents. If you are an R&D company developing fundamental new technology, the patent itself is your product.

The other day I gave a pitch to a potential investor at a gigantic tech company. They are one of the major players in the tech patent game. To them, the patents were really the *only* thing they were interested in, and whether or not they invest in U.S. will hinge upon whether or not they find our patents valuable enough.

Patents are really nothing more than a selling point, a bargaining chip. You could use them to threaten other companies who infringe, but the effort it would take to even detect that you're being infringed upon would be pointless. They really just make investors happy, and are just one more reason for them to invest in you.

A word on Trade Secrets. In Australia, my area of practice, these are enforced using s101 of the Corporations Act, which only allows for recourse against employees spilling the secrets, not the competitors using them. So it works mainly as a scare tactic rather than a real defensive weapon. Additionally there is no way to know, again in Australia, if your tech actually qualifies as a 'trade secret' until you go to court.

If it is based off of ground-breaking research or has a physical component to it, I'd probably push for a patent myself. 

But if it is something that is a derivative of pre-existing ideas or even a pre-existing idea, patenting it will be the biggest waste of time. 

I once talked to someone who discussed the idea of patenting the exact mechanism that an incredibly large (read: incredibly wealthy) internet company has already patented to oblivion. 

If someone isn't willing to listen to their CTO tell them why a technology patent isn't viable or a good use of a resources, they probably (most likely) do not respect you or your title and will continually roll over right over you. You are CTO for a reason. 

With that said, it is probably best to listen to others but personally I think CTO should have final say on whether a technology patent should be filed.

So basically my arguments:

* Because I said so.

* Because they are incredibly hard to defend unless incredibly proprietary

* Your 'mechanisms' become essentially public info and white-room implementation isn't that hard at all especially with purely programming. 

* It is a huge waste of time and effort. Startups are supposed to be nimble, willing / able to pivot and move quicker than bigger corporations. By purposefully slowing down development, you are giving any and all competitors who choose **not** to patent a lead / the ability to catch up.

I had a few concerns that I wanted to see addressed (such as our angle to the market). I simply didn't want to spend loads of time doing something only to realize that it was ahead of time or too late. My partner wanted to learn by doing. I realized we were about to hit a dead end if we pursue a particular idea and we'll burn out ourselves in the process. Time is money. And motivation is crucial. I started noticing that not only he hasn't caught up to speed with the work, but he wasn't handling the situation well emotionally. Something that he denied. But it was clear from his tone that frustration was catching up with him. Eventually, he, himself, decided to part ways saying that I wasn't very communicative (which is true near the latter stages). At first, I was totally distraught. I thought I was back at square 1 now. But a day later, it hit me that I simply graduated from stage 1. And I was ready to take my learning to the next level.

Now, for you to properly handle situations like these, **use contracts.** There are numerous resources available online and you can tweak the contracts to your business if ever. 

The one reason to go through the process of signing contracts is to avoid having all of those difficult questions you have stated above. 

In the contract, make things as clear as possible and make sure both parties understand what are the risks. 

Certain things that you may want to include in your contract are:

* How much equity will be given to the founder/employee if any equipment/money is given to grow the company.
* Make sure to include what happens to a founder/employee when he/she resigns with or without cause and is fired with or without cause.
* What happens to the equity/IP/equipment and anything else that the founder/employee has contributed to the company if the above applies.
* Make sure to have a witness sign with both of you during that meeting.
* Anything else that you think should be included and reviewed *before* going in business with the founder/employer to set things straight from the beginning, especially if you're the CEO and wants the majority of the control.

3zar2s,cykqgt8,GaryARefuge,">We are almost done designing the layout of the app on paper. What I mean by that is we have designed every 'page' of the App, what each button does, what it leads to, and the purpose of each button.

These are your wireframes.

Great job doing this. Many non-tech people don't ever do this. 

You've saved yourself a lot of time and money in the long run because the developers you show your wireframes to will have a much better understanding of what you want from them.

----------------------------

>Our question is - what's next? 

Shop your wireframes around to different developers/dev shops and get some estimates on the amount of time and money it will take to build your app.

Get some ideas on how much this will cost you. Ask for them to include estimated hours for each aspect of the project and not just a timeline of weeks to complete.  The amount of hours is really what you'll want to compare from each estimate.

Some developers are only back-end (the behind the scenes functions that you never see happening...all the programming that makes the thing alive). Some are only front-end (the way it looks and behaves in front of your eyes).  

It's very important you make sure you know what the people you are reaching out to are capable of doing. If they only do one thing you need to find another person/team to do the other.

It isn't any more or less expensive by nature to use a few different people vs one shop.  It just depends on the specific people and shops you're reaching out to.

> Do we come up with a name and color scheme and then hire a graphic designer? 

A name is important. But, not critical. The developers could very easily use a placeholder in what they are 

A color scheme, might be better left to a graphic designer. You might want to just identify a key color and allow the designer to put some schemes together around that key color and then allow you to choose which you feel is best.

Again, the shop you reach out to may have a graphic designer on their team. If not, you would want to hire a graphic designer first. There is a workflow to how an app is built. 

It's like making a movie. You don't just start filming a movie without a script or storyboards or actors or etc etc.

You usually want to have your wireframes (storyboards) and your product specifications (script) first. Then your final designs done (shoot your scenes). Then you would get your application coded by the front-end and back-end developers (edit your shots into an actual cohesive movie).

At least, that's a typical workflow I follow.

----------------------------

>How does hiring a programmer work?

For $20k, as an independent contractor. 

But, they may or may not be willing to work full time for you. 

That might not make any sense to the contractor or for you. 

How many hours will your project take to complete?  
How quickly do you NEED it? 

Is it worth them giving up working another contract to focus solely on yours?  

If they are only focused on your project they are taking a risk by not taking on another client. It's making your project their sole financial support. That's dangerous as a freelancer.

You asking them to make that commitment to be full-time might cost you more money in order to get that level of commitment from them.  Is that extra cost worth it to you just to get a project done a little faster?

The short answer is it works like hiring any other service person.

It boils down to what they think they are valued at and what you are willing to give them.

>That brings me to my next question - if you hire someone to build it (we want to work with someone local we can meet face to face, luckily we are in the silicon valley), and say the app takes off, do we hire that person on board full time?

I would say no.  If the app is taking off I would very much recommend you take your time and find the best possible candidate to bring on full time.  

It's like dating. Don't just marry the first person you happened to go on a few dates with.  You don't want to settle. 

Settling leads to bad times.

You want to take your time and be sure the person you hire fits your culture, your team, your goals, and other critical core requirements to work with them long term in an intimate setting.

Here is my bigger workflow to how I create a startup. It might help:

I share this often on Reddit when I come across a non-technical person struggling with getting their idea built. I figured I should share it here as well.

Here's my workflow for creating a startup:

1. Identify the main goal and purpose of the company

2. Identify the main product that supports that goal

3. Research what people use currently to meet the goal you are after

4. Outline the basic features for your product, making sure they all support the main product's purpose of supporting the company's goal

5. Research what other services/applications exist that may approach unrelated problems in a similar way to how you want to approach meeting your own goal

6. Refine your product outline to enhance the value you are offering

7. Prioritize your features by which ones are absolutely necessary to create a beneficial and supportive experience towards the overall goal of your company and product

8. Create an outline of your business plan and strategy. 

9. Create wireframes, product specifications, and user stories that clearly express how you plan to execute the build-out of your product based upon all your research, goals, and strategy.

10. Create your business plan, strategy, and product roadmap -- Be aware that EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR BUSINESS AFFECTS THE USER EXPERIENCE. The UX (user experience) isn't only controlled by the UI (user interface). The user experience is really what you are selling to people and you want to offer the best experience possible. Don't forget this!

11. Create simple validation tests using your wireframes that fit the context of your product specifications, user stories, and strategies.  

12. Analyze the results of your tests. Be sure to do so by keeping things in the proper context. If you ignore the context you render the data meaningless.  If the data validates your assumptions, great! If the data shows you that you were wrong in your assumptions, adapt your documents based upon what you learned and re-test until the data shows that you are on the right path.

13. Shop your blueprints around for estimates from dev shops and/or co-founders to fill those roles you can't do on your own

14. Create a pitch deck

15. Shop your pitch deck around for investors -- this could follow the next step, it depends on your funding situation and your ability to recruit tech co-founder(s)

15. Get stuff built, run tests, learn/adapt/pivot as necessary in order to generate traction


Now that you have a solid foundation to build upon the rest of your journey can begin!

You can't. Live with it or don't discuss it.

>4) Am i building up the cynicism too much in my head? should i just tell the investor chick all about it to make sure the idea isn't dumb, and I'm not a dumbass? 

Yes. Yes, but not in too much detail unless asked for specifics.

>5) Should i discuss it openly and stop being so cynical about business people? 

Yes.

>6) Or should i straight up be getting people to sign non-disclosure agreements?

Good luck with that. My slide deck is on a VCs desk right now. I sure didn't ask them to sign an NDA before taking a look at it.

tl:dr - Join a community at your school to share your ideas with like minded people and they will share in return. You might improve upon your idea or come to the realization that it is crap. You might meet your co-founders. You might find an Angel.

already China is seeing a technological edge over the rest of the world, such as mobile payments, and soon G5 networks, while other countries lag behind, including the US for all its technological capabilities

&#x200B;

China will definitely be the first country for mass self driving car adoption. most people are open to the idea, they have huge traffic congestion so they need it, they have the technological and economic capabilities, and as said the government has the power to make it happen, where in the US the government will be a big challenge

&#x200B;

But here is the question, say companies succeed in creating very safe self-flying planes, will any body fly on it? Will you fly on a plane with no human pilots? Pilots perform regular pre-flight checks of the plane before taking them off. Since their own life is at stake too passengers generally will feel more safe than when the pilot is not in the plane but in some office cabin far away or worse no human pilot at all. These are the type of ethical issues I am referring too. Because no matter how good the product is, if customers, that are humans reject it then it will have no market at all.

27mpu1,ci2l9dj,DigitalHeadSet,"I dont have any truely idealism based investments, but I do use my ideal as an as yet unattainable benchmark, and invest in coins heading in that direction.

I have two main opinions:

I favor coins with inbuilt inflation, because a deflationary 'currency' isnt really a currency at all. The point of a currency is not to increase in value but to *maintain* value. There is no point in a currency designed to increase in value. This is my major beef with Bitcoin, although of course i do hold bitcoin.

I oppose pure POS, because it discourages distribution/spending, and encourages hording. The analogy to Interest is incorrect, because in order to earn interest you need to loan your capital, which implies both risk, and the capital being put to work constructively elsewhere.

This leaves me in an interesting position: Any coin that fits those two criteria would be unattractive to passive investors. Something like etherum has other features which could attract investors, but it takes work, you dont just sit back and watch it grow. POS and deflationary are very attractive because, theoretically, its no-risk gains. People kind of expect that, because they're used to getting interest on their bank accounts (without really realising that they get interest because they're actually *loaning* their money to the bank, who uses the capital for other investments).

So my ideal coin would be one with programmable contracts a la etherum, some kind of in built loaning/investment system so investors can gain interest by putting their capital to work not just sitting on it, and some kind of dynamic block rewards system which self adjusts supply/inflation, to maintain a constant(ish) real value depending on movements in adoption, purchasing power etc. This kind of self regulatory algorithm
is the part that we dont have yet. It would require the crypto to actually know its own buying power, without external reference, which is pretty difficult. It could perhaps be done by monitoring the number of transactions and average transaction volume, but it would take a much better mind than mine to figure out exactly how. It would also be susceptible to manipulation.

Let's break it down to primitive structure and thinking.. 

To think that a piece of code and some miners around the world could outplay major powers on earth is kind of naive. If BTC or other anarchic trys of establishing a new world order would disturb the rulers - and losing power would be definitely disturbing - they could simply destroy the needed infrastructure. Lets say they switch of the power or in a extrem scenario they could simply bomb down some mining farms and outplay the system.  

Ofc this is an extreme scenario but there are powers able to do that. BTC could maybe gain some economic weight but at the end some military action could destroy the system. You would need military forces who defend the system of BTC (or others)  and that would again end up in centralization :)

As I said I think it is naive to think that BTC (or others) could replace or destroy current structures of power.

But to counter we also know crypto is unregulated and full of marketing and stupid people, having projects pop up and print money (not talking about ripple specifically here but in general) and selling it for millions is exactly the thing bitcoin was created against.

bfj71l,elex0nr,theniath,"Possibly not an outright scam, but absolutely the most inept and unprofessional team I've come across in crypto.

Most holders have been banned from their Telegram page, which is now full of the team's alt accounts praising each other. 

Tracking wallets shows that any RLX pumps have been a result of team wallets buying, and that the team have been selling into dumps, sometimes well below market price.

An anonymous admin known as Jon went rogue a while ago and released a load of private messages in which the team took the piss out of investors, admitted selling into their own buy orders, said that FINRA approval was off the table, and bitched about each other. He admitted releasing this stuff because he had tried to blackmail them but they had refused. He then set up a Telegram group that contained the CMO's home address and said he would get the CMO sent to jail for insider trading. (The community have put together a 75-page document showing that the CMO was trading behind the scenes - he resigned then was mysteriously given a role again.)

Jon then suddenly deleted all his messages, apologised and said he'd make a mistake and that actually the team were great. Soon after he admitted the team had paid him off, and resumed his fudding. Recently the CEO popped up in the trader Telegram group to invite Jon to meet him 1:1 in London to ""talk"". He said that if Jon didn't want to, then he would travel to Croydon to talk to him - implying that Jon has been identified. Jon immediately said he had changed his mind and wanted the project to succeed, and deleted his account again. Another exec then appeared in trader chat to shoot down anyone unhappy with how things were going. Since then he's been a regular fixture, maintaining that Relex have done very little wrong and that the problem here is the community. Absolutely brilliant entertainment.

They announced an 'official partnership' with the United Nations then borrowed half a table at a UN event to hand out leaflets. They paid a no-mark Youtuber to publicise them and he made a weird video with an exec team member about his relationship with God. They've created about six new coins which are used to lock RLX tokens, and now claim those tokens have been 'invested'. And a couple of weeks ago the CEO said that RLX had ""one of the, if not the, greatest bullruns of 2018"".

A year ago if someone tried to sell you on DASH or NEO you may have been skeptical, but if you bought in on either for 10k you are making around $50-60k just in dividends alone, and then the value of the currency itself has gone up 100x.

5eiq23,dacvv3r,Kr1tya3,"This one is a bit tricky. The answer to your last question is no. Selling shares does not hurt the _company_. The only effect you can have is to move the price down, however this is virtually impossible as a small investor. If by any chance you are Warren Buffet or George Soros, then a selloff that you make will likely cause the price to plummet, annoying the board members and management of the company who are shareholders (as individuals) as well. In an extreme case a crashed price could also cause a competitor to swoop in and acquire a substantial stake in the company. However like I mentioned, this is an impossible scenario for an average investor. (For more, see: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/020703.asp)


Now for your broader question of should you divest from unethical companies, the question is less clear cut. I am an enthusiastic environmentalist, but I would argue that you shouldn't. First: If you hold these stocks indirectly through an investment fund, then obviously you don't have control of what the fund invests in. You could go for a so-called ethical or green fund, but often these operate at very high fees, underperform and most importantly have varying standards of ethics. For example would you be happy to invest in gun or tobacco companies? How about palm oil companies, big fishing companies or big pharma companies? If you choose to invest on ethical grounds then it will be virtually impossible to find a fund that exactly matches your ethical standards. Second: If you hold the stocks directly, then as I mentioned, your sell-off would have no effect. Also you would again be faced with doing constant detailed research on what a company does and how it matches your standards. And finally, as a small investor you actually do have a small amount of power. You can go to the annual shareholder meeting or write to the investor relations department and urge them to do the right thing. If you sell, maybe you'll sell to someone who doesn't care about these things. 


And finally to suggest something different: As a consumer you have greater influence on a company than as a small investor. I would leave your investments alone and instead focus on reducing your own environmental impact. ",ethical investing
32eywp,cqathij,knowyourbrain,"I support this divestment campaign. However this article does not address it's biggest conundrum: It does not matter what you invest in because in an economy driven by burning fossil fuels, any capital investments will contribute to their use. An obvious example would be investing in Ford or GM after divesting in gas companies. 

Of course the capitalist engine is destroying more than just the atmosphere as this line suggests:

>An earlier version of the Gates investment philosophy explained why the foundation was wary of divestment campaigns. Much of it was a “slippery slope” argument: if the Gates Foundation divested from every firm which failed social responsibility tests, soon there’d be almost nothing left to invest in.

Italy was taking on large amounts of debt to facilitate that growth before 1992 though. It went from 40% of GDP in the 80s to almost 100% already in 1992. And that is with a growing GDP each year, so debt was massively outpacing economic growth.

4e2abr,d1wfwql,Serupael,"Its an interesting and very detailed read, kudos. A few quick things to consider that popped up in my head:

- The language threshold would almost certainly mean a death sentence to small regional languages like Friulian, Sorbian or Ladin. For me, an integral part of every concept for a ""United States of Europe"" are provisions to protect the rich and numerous cultural traditions across the continent, it would be fatuous to essentially plan and engineer their decay. For this, more and smaller provinces would make sense.

- Your prefectures (which are, of course, primarily there to illustrate your idea) not only cut across old geographic, but also linguistic borders. The Dresden prefecture would host german, polish and czech communities of considerable size. Yes, a similar concept *sort of* works in Switzerland, but still poses a big challenge for a lot of people now probably feeling detached from their past and background now living in what would feel pretty artificial borders. 

- For a nation of such size and demographic variety, imo MMP is far better suited for parlamentary representation than a simple proportional voting. Your system is based on single party lists nationwide. I understand your rationale on this against a splintering of the parliament into numerous small regional parties, but it also poses a high danger of leading to a political caste based in Frankfurt (or any other capital), considered detatched and arrogant especially in the more remote and rural areas of the nation. Im also not a fan of an unelected upper house, but thats just me. 

- Why would you need *grandes écoles* or those meritocratic provisions in general? If jobs in the imperial administration offer a high prestige, you would automatically get the bright minds from the college graduates. I dont see a need for special ""imperial schools"" here, as it would lead to a devaluation of regular public universities.

There is no way you can have an Imperial European capital in Germany, at least not without the Chancellery not immediately becoming known as ""the bunker"". This is of course a highly idealized imagination, but a political capital would probably be better stationed around the Benelux countries: close enough to the center, unlike say Stockholm or Rome, without being in either a major country like London or Paris, or in Germany.

Aesthetics do matter, when it comes to proposals like this; on the same note I'd make a remark about the very aggressive and fairly non-democratic title of empire. I realize ""Union"" or ""Federation"" is neither quite what you are actually envisioning, nor particularly strong titles, but to me at least, a European Empire carries overtones of bloodshed, incessant warfare and incestuous, dynastic politics, rather than a well-organized, peaceful democracy.",ethical investing

e5y86l,f9mqhbn,OkraMonk,"I'm maybe not the best person to ask since I've been sewing since I was a kid, but for me a sewing machine is an essential household maintenance tool. You can use it to repair almost everything that has cloth in your house: clothes, potholders, placemats, even tote bags. 

A used or cheap new machine should only run you a couple hundred dollars in the US, and whatever classes cost on top of that. As far as sewing supplies go, they are usually really easy to get second hand as there's always some grandmotherly type who has a sewing kit stashed away that she doesn't use anymore. For reference, I just bought my first spool of thread in about 5 years, and that was only because I'm picky and wanted a specific color of thread.

For clothes repair, you really hardly need any skills at all to make a decent patch. I use fusible interfacing, which is basically an iron-on adhesive, to attach patches and then I just zigzag over them as much as I can stand. It adds years of life to blue jeans, and if you put the patches on the inside and match the thread color to your jeans you can barely see the repair.

It sounds like the thing you hated was making clothes. Honestly, I hate making clothes too. It's a tedious process and, as you said, reversing the pattern and getting it all pinned, etc is a pain in the butt IMO. Some people are great at it, but not me. However, I've managed to find so many uses for my sewing machine that do not involve making clothes from scratch. Mending things, sewing blankets, quilts, and bags... That's what I mostly use my machine for and I'd say it's paid for itself hundreds of times over by letting me buy less and use things for longer.

Whenever I wear them, especially on chilly mornings when I exercise and train my dog, I am happy.

I echo the ""learn to handsew"" recommendations.  Sewing machines are great and make stronger seams (important for clothing and sturdiness), but hand sewing is best for many repairs and for the finishing touches on a lot of garments.

e5y86l,f9ohk2v,theinfamousj,"My present sewing machine stable says yes, however the answer is no. While a sewing machine is an amazing convenience machine that will do repetitive tasks for you, a nice hand needle and some thread and the proper sewing technique will do you just the same, if a bit slower.

In general, I sew cosplay items. I've made plenty of costumes on my sewing machines. But the last one was a four way stretch spandex that I didn't have the proper sewing machine attachment to be able to stitch on (the feed dogs of the machine just stretched the fabric meant to stretch and so didn't feed the fabric through the machine and so nothing was working), and instead of investing in the attachment for this one time project, I just broke out a hand needle and stitched up all of the seams by hand.

What I could have taken just an evening to construct with a machine-- were my machine to work with the fabric-- took one month of hand stitching in spare moments, but we got there in the end.

So, only you can know how much your time is worth and how skilled you are at planning ahead. But I will tell you this, you are going to have more quid to spend on other things if you go with a hand needle and thread (and a properly fitting thimble). If you wanted to go a little bit extra fancy, an embroidery hoop or a ""third hand"" (it clamps to a table and has a clip to hold your fabric) add tension to the fabric to allow you to make your stitches even in their thread tension. But those aren't necessary. People who were against spending unnecessary money would just pin their work to their knees (to the skirts on their knees or the trousers on their knees more accurately) in order to tension the fabric and thread as that works the same.

There are plenty of PDFs of old hand stitching textbooks to read through and learn from so that you can develop the appropriate technique.

Obviously, while I can (and have, and do) hand stitch, I also own not just one but more than one sewing machine, so I completely support the ownership thereof. I offer this to a first time sewing machine owner, if that is going to be you: Don't spend over $40/GBP30.51 for a machine unless you need (not just might use) a feature that the more expensive machine has to offer.",ethical investing

To me, zero waste is about what I don't buy than what I do. It's not what I consume, but how I consume, and how I consume less. The only zero waste purchase I've ever made was a steel Thermos. 

It's not about buying organic cotton from a zero waste store, it's about not being responsible for the creation of ANY new stuff if possible. 

Instead of paper towels, you can use cloths. You don't have to buy new cloths. In fact, I'd say it's more zero waste to just cut up some old t shirts and hem the edges. If you don't have any old t shirts, ask around friends and family or visit a thrift store.

I'm not sure about razors, as I've been using an electric beard trimmer for 20 years, but I'd imagine a solid dollar store razor that takes replacement blades would be OK. It's not the biggest problem, so it doesn't have to be a huge priority. 

For food, I think the first step is to simply reduce the waste you create at home. Buy smaller amounts and use up what you have. You don't have to buy cloth bags, use old plastic bags.

Unfortunately most of the social housing I know of is being sold by the local councils (30,000 tennants) to private companies to make a fast buck,  which now puts the burden of the companies profits for the tenants to make up for-be it by rent increase or the company decreasing costs by cutting services/quality.One of the buildings has been completely gutted and refurbed to a higher standard with the hope of attracting private renters for more money. The market is going to end up over saturated at the top end and under supplied at the bottom end purely through greed.

Surely it would make sense for the councils to supply homes for students/welfare/those on lower incomes as they are the people they subsidise the most- no need for their money to go into somebodies' supplementary pension pot.

I currently hold accounts with them and 4 other Banks and Nationwide's online banking is the best and easiest to use I've ever seen. Also it is relatively easy to get a credit card from them.",ethical investing

The online banking is, to be fair, only Good Enough but their phone banking support is *superb*.

ubx6z,c4u19j3,Disgruntled__Goat,"HSBC are pretty good in general. Never had any problems with their online banking, it's very easy to use. HSBC are one of the few banks to weather the recessions quite well.

Don't know about their ethics, though. What kind of things were Halifax investing in that caused you to cancel your account?",ethical investing

ubx6z,c4ufeb6,codine,"Barclays are good for online banking, and give out a free security pad; insert your card, enter your pin, then enter the resulting number into the webpage for verification.  I use the site often, and I've never had any issues with it.

The one time I had to use the phone, I ended up speaking to an English person (going by accent) who was helpful in what I needed.

Furthermore, they offer a 'basic' bank account with no fees per month.

All in all, I'm quite happy with them.",ethical investing

Not sure if you'd call them ethical. Not sure what you require from them on that front.

Anyway, don't listen to me. I chose Firstdirect because of my particular situation, yours will be different. [This is the absolutely best guide on choosing a bank account.](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts)",ethical investing
jl0ud4,gapoq1k,Pheer777,"Maybe this is selfish on my part and regressive thinking, but I'd rather just keep doing things as I do now. 

If I, as one independent person, do my part to reduce carbon emissions, I don't want to act as a datapoint suggesting that things are better as they are now. I'd rather keep using oil and gas-producing services so there is more impetus to address the institutional roots of the problem, not shame individuals for being antagonists to progress.

I'd rather the industry evolve to the point where everyone can have an electric car at low prices, rather than encourage people to embrace austerity or go out of their comfort zones to make an insignificant impact.

Maybe I'm just cynical. If someone wants to do their small part to go green, by all means go for it.",ethical investing

ab6mix,ed0422f,lukashiel,"I would love to add to this that I think its important to note that there is a stigma surrounding nuclear energy; as if it is taboo. Nuclear plants have improved substantially relative to Chernobyl and Fukushima. The plants of today are engineered to very strict rules (which is very good), yet people are still afraid. When we think of fossil fuels, the new generation understands the implications for global warming, but not the real chance of a drilling rig explosion. All in all, every energy source (renewable or not) has benefits and downsides, but we can't get rid of nuclear in the near future. Yes, radioactive waste exists. Storage methods are safe even from natural disasters (if done correctly), its an issue of volume. However, we should spend more resources on finding whether or not this waste can be chemically treated. Due to fear of nuclear, we will rely too much on fossil fuels. Global warming is still our priority. ",ethical investing

What the links you provided don't consider is how much storage with respect to renewable energy is required such that the system is renewable and self-sustaining. ,ethical investing
