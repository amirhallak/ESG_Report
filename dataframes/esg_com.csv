It's interesting to hear about her work. The main thing I get from our conversations is that no one has any idea what sustainable investing actually means, mainly the ""investing"" part.  There is the low hanging fruit of not investing in major polluters, gun and tobacco manufacturers, etc, but beyond that it's a mess. Not at all like academia. None of the important projects can be invested in because they don't show a path to actual returns, or aren't things that can legally be invested in. Half the other projects require you to take a political stance on something and piss off a portion of your investors.

I'd go to a few ESG conferences to network if you can afford them- it's not a huge world. 

If you're on the east coast it's a lot easier than where I am on the west coast because there are far more SRI/ESG based financial companies. 

So far as I can tell, the skill sets are the same- analyzing companies to see if they're good investments. If you're excited about the topic, it's pretty easy to just add in the ESG aspects. It helps that more and more companies are reporting on those aspects, which wasn't the case even 10 years ago in the US.

bhao4p,els5ebe,mydogspothas1leg,"I’m a credit analyst at a large MF. I cover credits for my day job but have been leading our move into ESG on the side (goes to show the amount of dedicated resources that are going into this... though admittedly we have a more built out team in equity). There’s a lot to like about ESG for active managers, not least of which is the fact that it’s one of the few areas of our industry that is growing. I also think a lot of ESG analysis carries over to traditional credit research (mainly the G).

There are two roads to being in an impactful ESG investment role: either coming from a traditional investment background or starting out as a sustainability specialist like at a MSCI/Sustainalytics/etc. From my experience with other large MFs, trying to hire someone who is passionate about ESG but can think like an investor is really hard. For that reason, I’d recommend going toward a traditional investment role first (assuming you aren’t able to find an ESG investment role starting position) rather than the alternative. Everyone is scrambling to have an ESG pitch right now, so you will probably have opportunity at any investment shop to be involved if you voice your interest early on. Having your prior experience will help. Also I suspect your comp will be better if you take that route.

I really like the ESG work I do. It’s a different lens and quite interesting. It has also made me the go-to person for every ESG question that comes up (really good exposure).

But I am trying to convince my bank to create a fund based on sustainability. I manned up and sat next to the CEO of the bank in the main office’s cafeteria a couple of months ago, introduced myself, and told him why we need such a fund. He said what everyone says: we don’t have any good ways of measuring it. I countered with that we do, gave him a framework to build on, and encouraged him to see the upside of us being amongst the first of our biggest competitors to launch such a fund. He got mildly annoyed and stopped the conversation. But luckily he realized that I had managed to irk him through good arguments, and he gave me a grin before he took off. Haven’t met him since. 

I guess I really felt like sharing this story. But the point I’m trying to make here is that we still are in the early stages of this. But this is undoubtedly the future.

I would strongly advice you to continue the path that you are on as long as it includes networking, while you work on a deep understanding of both sustainability, how to measure it, and of course: finance and analytics. Many fall in the trap of thinking too big; being naive idealists. The truth is that sustainability-oriented companies are starting to make money. We can make a positive impact while we are making money. It’s fucking great.

htley9,fyhxrwx,,"Equity and high yield are totally different areas tbh. Your probs at a small AM if you are doing both. 

Large cap equity is so efficient nowadays, I believe large cap equity MF's/blue chip dividend MF's will continue to die slowly. Small cap equities are way less efficient, I can see large asset managers retaining assets there. Overall, the people vocal against passive equities are silly IMO. 

High yield/bond indexing is actually trash though. When you buy an equity market cap weighted index you are agreeing that you should own more large companies than small. Perfect, makes sense. When you buy an aggregate bond ETF, you are agreeing that companies with the most debt should be granted the largest allocation. That makes 0 sense. Add in that the indexes are higher duration than the 1990's despite 1/5th the yield and you have an entire market of people who will be destroyed by rising rates/inflation. A 5% increase over the next decade would cause a 40% cumulative loss over that span. 

All the risk metrics are super skewed too, you notice how pro-passive bond ETF's (cough, vangaurd) always flex 'per unit of risk' returns to compare to active funds? Well, it's because the average active bond manager beats the benchmark in absolute terms. Why does Vanguard win per unit of risk as defined by SD? It's because over 50% of the index doesn't trade on a given day, which artificially nerfs the vol. 

I work in the alts arm of my asset manager so I don't have a horse in this race. I think active equities will keep bleeding and be a shadow of what they are today, but I can't see passive bonds existing like they do today.

htley9,fyhr6wd,FinanceCorpStrategy,"Asset management has probably peaked. I work in strategy at a top one. It’s expected throughout the industry that move to passives and fee compression will continue in the short and mid term. Active funds kept claiming they’d generate alpha during volatile markets and down markets...and then they pretty much all got beat by passive indexes during Covid, so there’s really no reason left anyone would stay in active equities. Any claims of superior returns are really just survivorship bias. 

For bonds, active bond funds still outperform passives, but with CREI funds taking off, I’m sure they will start beating active bond funds at 1/4 the cost too. 

Large players will survive through scale and distribution, and you can still get high fees in alternatives (real estate, private equity, private credit), emerging markets, and some solutions products (but even then tdfs are under massive fee compression), but the industry has probably peaked and you’ll see declining headcount and mid-sized shops folding.

There’s lots of money being poured into renewables and many small businesses I’ve heard from are working to become more sustainable. The transition doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s occurring much faster than many experts predicted . It helps that wind and solar is competitive with fossil fuels from a price standpoint.  California is getting somewhere around 20% of its energy from renewables whereas a few years ago it was a fraction of a percent. 

According to the US energy information administration (EIA) wind or solar energy will represent 76% of all new energy capacity brought online in 2020. On the flip side over 50% of all retired plants will be coal. Transitioning a huge economy like the US to being totally sustainable (from an energy perspective) is years away but the massive progress that’s been made since 2010 shouldn’t be ignored.

This aspect of ESG is a good thing. However, I have much more mixed feelings on the other major justification for ESG investing that IM firms, such as my own, have been using to market these types of products: that ESG outperforms ([https://www.ft.com/content/f99b0399-ee67-3497-98ff-eed4b04cfde5](https://www.ft.com/content/f99b0399-ee67-3497-98ff-eed4b04cfde5)).

ESG will be a self fulfilling prophesy for a while, as the market continues to adopt more ESG practices and  firms continue to roll out new ESG-based strategies to capitalize on the newest craze. Further growth into ESG managed products, whether active or passive, will cause a demand spike for those companies who have favorable ESG ratings, which will cause their share price to increase as a result (assuming no bad news).

As such, ESG will cause P/E multiples to rise for these companies, but the rate of rise here will be fundamentally unrelated to the financial situation of the underlying business for most of these companies. This will have effects on the stock market at large - it could be a catalyst to a huge bull run for these companies, it could cause a further shift toward value stocks where there isn't such a price premium baked in, or others.

However, one thing is certain: when the next market correction occurs, the individuals who bought into the false promise that they would enjoy better returns as a result of investing in ESG products could be in a rough position.",esg

The fund I'm in requires additional exclusions (""ESG plus""), such as alcohol, recreational cannabis, gambling, fossile fuels etc, and the fund has to be frequently reviewed by a third party.

I chose that fund because I don't have any power to change the world in any significant way but I can vote with my wallet, so to say.",esg

Keep in mind pretty much every company is evil. They are driven only by a profit incentive. They exploit labour, destroy the environment, spy on you and commoditize your private information, poison you with awful food, price gauge you on medicine and health care, they're usurers who make you into a debt serf for life, they lobby your government to change the rules to their benefit and your loss.

je9zz5,g9dduym,-WastingTime-,"To answer your question at the top of the comment, I think mutual funds will continue their dominance in the retirement space, but lose to ETFs in taxable accounts. 

From a WSJ article in 2019, mutual funds had almost $20 trillion in AUM compared to about $4 trillion in ETFs. I don't think mutual funds are really going to disappear anytime soon (or in the next 50 years). People are very slow to change their investments when it doesn't have too much of an affect. They'd rather continue their habits already created. 

One thing to think about, if you have a $50k capital gain in a mutual fund, say VFIAX, can Vanguard transition that into VOO while keeping your cost basis and not triggering a taxable event? I have no idea, so if anyone does know, I'd be curious. 

Speaking of taxes, I can certainly see why ETFs would gain more traction in taxable accounts (different from your example). They are insanely tax efficient, rarely distributing a capital gain to the holder due to how they can handle secondary transactions. Even funds with extraordinarily high turnover seem to avoid a capital gains distribution. It's also possible regulation ends that at some point. 

WSJ article - they have some caveats on the data and there is probably a pay wall

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/etfs-get-all-the-buzz-but-mutual-funds-still-dominate-theres-a-reason-11570414020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/etfs-get-all-the-buzz-but-mutual-funds-still-dominate-theres-a-reason-11570414020)",esg
je9zz5,g9dajxx,MasterCookSwag,"A ton of people bring up all of these nuances of the two, but until I can set an automatic investment in to an ETF and not have to use some stupid app I’m using mutual funds.  Most people simply don’t want to be bothered with logging in and executing orders every month.",esg
je9zz5,g9damjj,Beastrick,Many retirement accounts don't allow ETFs so you need mutual fund for those. Invesco just recently released their QQQ mutual fund to make it accessible to retirement accounts so I don't think they are considering giving up on those. Vanguard creates a lot of ETFs to offer more specific choices for investors that are more active and want to fine tune their holdings. That kind of precision is usually not needed for retirement accounts so there is no need to create mutual fund version. They both have a place there so I don't see neither replacing other.,esg

je9zz5,g9dmm8z,jnrbsn,"For Vanguard index funds specifically, there's no difference in tax efficiency between mutual funds and ETFs. There are a lot of benefits to mutual funds for long-term investing. So I guess the main question is whether the lower expense ratio of Vanguard's ETFs is worth giving up the benefits of mutual funds. I think the answer is no.

If you look at Vanguard's five main index funds that someone is likely to have in a long-term retirement portfolio (the four total market funds plus the S&P 500 fund), the average difference in expense ratio between the admiral shares mutual fund and the ETF is 0.019%.

j9xa2e,g8mqw2n,Meymo,"Great summary. I would think that another key consideration when evaluating the past performance of active managers is taking into consideration how policies have shaped outcomes. Consider that the investing environment even 15 years ago is very different than the environment today. 

I would argue that we're currently in a favorable environment for risk taking, especially in the equity market as we have low rates, on-going spending (stimulus and/or additional government programs that will get passed over the next 2 years, regardless of who wins the election), and a supportive appetite for lending across the board. 

Since you mentioned ARK Funds, the other thing to consider here are the themes that they're currently exploring. I don't think any of us would argue that Fintech, Internet, Genomics, or Robotics will disappear in the next 5-10 years. Whether Paypal or Square are still used five years from now is irrelevant so long as the fintech theme is still trending. ARK allows one to capture relevant companies within a trend, and as long as the theme persists, I would imagine that the ARK funds will do well.

Consider IHI, which is one of the older thematic ETFs out there (Medical Device ETF). It's outperformed the S&P in both drawdowns and compound returns [since 2007](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=IHI&allocation1_1=100).

Beat the market as proxied by the SPX is shown to be difficult and mostly unprovable, but there was an S&P study that showed that most funds underperformed their peer groups and stated benchmark. For example, small cap value funds on average underperformed the Russell 2000 Value. 

Ibbotson and Sharpe have research showing that the average fund will underperform. This is mathematically obvious because the average of all major market participants is simply the market less fees. S&P Research clarified this further to show that past performance is completely unreliable for future prediction. 

What other verifiable metric is there to show which managers will outperform? Outside of qualitative analysis, there isn't much. I remember reading a Journal of Finance article that had manager tenure and firm size as good quantitative factors for Fund potential. Manager education also might've been in there. 

Jury is still out on the active share metric. Just because a fund is different doesn't mean it has good picks: you have to be different AND right. Agree that there are funds that CAN outperform but for most it really isn't worth the time or headache to find them. Even if you pick a winner, behavioral discipline matters most. Like several others have said on the sub, even though Lynch's returns were legendary, the average investor in his fund lost money.

I think better time would be spent focusing on financial planning rather than investment analysis for the vast majority of retail investors. With proper planning, you put the investments in the right perspective. It becomes much less about maxing out your money and much more about living a better life. Goals also set the volatility in perspective, e.g. that money is for 10 years from now so it's ok to go down in the short run.

iv3ha2,g5ouui5,Chii,"Have a watch of https://youtu.be/weVAN2HxXjk - it explains a very good case for not investing in ESG funds unless you are completely sure they match exactly your moral values (rather than just marketing). And ESG funds tend to underperform (and charge higher management fees). They underperform because the selection criteria may remove some diversification affects, and others remove profitable companies that make up the total returns of a fund that don't discriminate. 

So in other words, you're paying (fees and underperformance) for essentially a personal preference/taste. If you feel that is worth it - then go ahead. 

My take is that i don't care for anything _except_ for maximum returns. Then, if you feel strongly about ESG, put your money into charities that deal with these issues. Taking action yourself (whether by donating, or by actually doing work for these charities) will have a bigger effect. Divesting from companies you consider unethical will just make the spot open for someone else to invest in - and at a lower price since you removed your own demand that would've pushed the buy-in price higher!",esg
iv3ha2,g5oua5g,dvdmovie1,"It's certainly not a fad - there has been tremendous inflows into ESG products, but - and this is a very cynical take - in many cases that's what they are, ""products."" If you look through many ESG funds, you will often find that some inclusions are questionable at best. I think if people really want something ESG that meets their personal criteria, they're going to have to shop around or build a portfolio themselves. 

""Is the sustainability of a company something you look at when investing, or is the bottom line and potential growth more important?""

Ultimately, if there's not potential growth, it's probably not going to be around at some point. I think the issue that I have with a lot of green investing is that people think ""it's green and green is good and therefore it's a good business"" when that couldn't be further from the truth. There have been/is/will be many terrible/mediocre green businesses. Sun Edison was a terrible business but all the way down to bankruptcy, people on here were going, ""it's solar and solar is good so it's good right?"" No. Something can be green/sustainable and that's nice but if it's not ultimately a good business it's not going to be around for very long.

""But I don't know whether this attitude will end up with me missing out on the gains of other sectors (tech, finance, energy)""

I think you can certainly find some green energy investments that are fine, but certainly you'll miss out on big oil (not that there's anything much to miss there, with most of those companies being stagnant for years even before this crisis.) Much of tech should be fine. Finance? Go invest in MSCI which will probably continue to see a lot of growth in various ESG products, such as ratings (https://www.msci.com/esg-ratings)",esg

I don't invest in petroleum/fossil fuels. I chose instead to invest in ACES. 

I don't invest in tobacco either (no Philip Morris for me).

If you want to only invest in ""ethical"" companies that is your choice. But just pick and choose your own. Unless  you are an activist investor your $ amount will have no impact on the ethicalness of your companies so it's really up to you. Just whatever you do don't pay a high expense ratio for the sake of being ethical. Just read about companies before you buy.",esg
iv3ha2,g5pmis4,Beastrick,"If company promotes sustainable technolgies then I usually see it as a good thing. Sustainable will likely be profitable in a long term eg. renewable energies constantly are developing and margins are improving so there is definitely also money to be made and not just being ethical. There are companies that are more towards ethical than profit but there are also some good companies out there that can do both. Money is what matters in the end.

The key is managing the risk and budgeting appropriately with your investments. You are *never* going to do everything perfectly with your portfolio. You will never absolutely maximize everything. So do your best to get reasonably close, and then do what you want and makes you happy in a responsible way.

A long time ago when I dabbled in forex, I heard a rule which has really helped sculpt a lot of my trading activities. ""Never put more than 2% of your net worth into a single trade.""

Basically, 2% is enough to make modest returns if your gamble pays off. But if it goes completely belly up, while losing 2% of your portfolio sucks, it isnt something that couldn't happen in a day's worth of market fluctuations (everyone here has probably had a day where their net worth went up or down 2% in a day). So it sucks, but not that bad.

Personally, I don't even actively trade anymore. I just buy and hold indexes, and set aside some portion of my portfolio to be used for specific companies or niche ETFs I want to invest in because I think they will pay off (CRSP, ICLN, BRK, MJ).",esg

If you set something like 10% of money for stock picking, and you were right in a big way (i.e. 100% gain in the year), that will only contribute 10% to your overall portfolio, so it really mutes your upside, but it also mutes your downside. That's how you should view it. You are not likely to be right, especially in that large of a way, but it doesn't matter.

Hello so I am a 26 male. [landlord] in [Canada] I have done well with my current finances and now I am looking at buying a rental property. I am looking for any advice on the best way to get into it and start out on the right track. I have a few questions.

h8sqp5,futn4ij,Obariste,"Hi, I'd like to start by giving some background and look for some suggestions and advice to help maximize my investing. Feel free to review and comment below..I've clearly made some mistakes and looking to put together a strong action plan to stick to to avoid them in the future.

I'll start by answering the guideline questions.

I am 31 years old working as a manufacturer's sales representative tied to the window and door manufacturing industry (which as you can probably assume is tightly connected with the construction industry and ebbs and flows as such).

I live in the midwest and my housing cost is about $1300/month for my current residence. I have a good deal of equity in the home and just refinanced to a 3.25% 30 year mortgage. I also own 2 rental properties which I also have on lower interest fixed rate mortgages and after putting 25% down for each they yield about a 14% return on investment based on cash-flow and equity pay down (not counting any appreciation) or about $1000-1200/month or so.

Currently I make $50,000/base salary with last years commissions being about 40,000. That should be about the same this year even when accounting for the slow down and the company also pays for my phone, health insurance and $1050 for vehicle depreciation and home office (although expenses, gas and vehicle maintenance are paid separately by the company). Lets call it about $100,000/year assuming my commissions don't tank in a worsening recession.

Cash on hand: $10,000 currently.

Retirement fund: $41,000 in a 401K S&P index fund at the time of this writing.

No big debts aside from the mortgages on my 3 homes and my primary vehicle which although a depreciating asset I bought pretty smart and with a low interest rate.

Non-retirement stock portfolio: This is where I'm looking for some advice...I'd first started investing in stocks about 4 years ago and had just been adding to a Vanguard S&P 500 index which had seen solid growth since. I used this as some what of a bank account while I worked on getting approved for financing for rental properties and saved up money. The trouble started after Covid hit and I decided to try to time the market by liquidating this fund when it was about 7% away from it's all time high or about $64,000 in total.

I then started stock picking in some stocks which I felt would have a significantly higher percentage gain in the shorter term once things got back to normal and certain sectors that got especially impacted began to get back on track. This resulted in one embarrassing gamble that cost me 16K. Following that loss I decided to diversify a little better by picking up a few different stocks and currently hold 30 positions in the following symbols:

PII, HLT, GOOG,AMZN, NFLX, AMD, MSFT, FB, SBUX, MAR, AAL, AMC, CCL, CNK, RCL, CAKE, RRGB, DAL, UAL, F, AAPL, GE, BA, XOM, PLAY and my largest holding by far is DIS which I felt would be a safe choice if this crisis persists with good upside because of still being significantly off their ATHs, the amount of diversification within the company and the prospect of significant growth within Disney +.

I now feel that this decision to move funds out of the index and into individual stocks may have been hasty and actually set me back significantly (especially with the big loss) with my portfolio currently sitting at a market value of about $43,000 after the significant dip late last week.

I worry that I may see additional losses if any of the more risky picks declare bankruptcy especially with the possibility of a second wave on the horizon and although I have time to wait at 31 I'd like to use my capital in the most efficient way to maximize returns (as I'm sure everyone would). I am also hoping for somewhat of a quicker bounce-back so I can pull some money out to use toward obtaining another rental property especially in the event of a drop in real estate prices (need about 60K for down payment and closing costs on the types of properties I look for) although if the only option is to sell at a loss I could wait to save up more without having to sell any stocks.

I've also recently heard that when stock-picking studies show that if you are going to try diversifying with more then 10 stocks you're better off just going with the overall market. Can anyone confirm that? It makes sense but clearly shows other flaws in my strategy up to this point if true.

Also, the more I read the more difficult it appears to be to beat market performance over any length of time. I knew that but thought that this black swan event opened up opportunities to beat the market in the short term and speed up growth with the idea to continue using the S&P index as the long-term backbone of my portfolio.

I'm also curious to hear thoughts as to what percentage of my income/portfolio should be spent on more risky speculative investments. I understand the safest option would be to continue regularly contributing to an index fund and just set it and forget it but the prospect of picking a company that ends of becoming the leader in AI or software for self-driving cars or other new technologies and seeing a 10,000%+ return seems worth gambling something for that life-changing type of investment. I love researching companies and technologies but I understand I need a lot more work on understanding how to properly research company fundamentals and stock evaluations. Any book or other recommendations to help me build this knowledge?

h8sqp5,fustr4y,mjwells12,"Hi guys, weighing up the following two funds to invest in:

ESG Developed world all cap equity fund

https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-esg-developed-world-all-cap-equity-index-fund-accumulation-shares/overview?intcmpgn=equityglobal_esgdevelopedworldallcapequityindexfund_fund_link

https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-s-and-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing/overview?intcmpgn=equityusa_sp500ucitsetf_fund_link

I'm leaning towards ESG Developed world due to the screening process companies go through - this is pretty important to me.

From what I can see, past performance of the ESG has been good since its inception (although I know this isn't a reliable indicator of future performance).

The ESG fund is also well distributed across multiple countries, and has a similar industry exposure to the S&P500, which (correct me if I'm wrong) minimises the risk of it.

I'm basically weighing this up against the s&p because I know how much longer the s&p has been around and I know it's a very popular choice for passive investors.

 I'm essentially looking for a fund as similar to the s&p as possible, with some kind of ethical screening process behind it. This ESG fund seems like the best shot so far.

I'm not trying to be lazy and look for a golden answer for 'which is better'. 

I really want to know if there's anything I've overlooked when trying to weigh up the risks of investing in this ESG fund, and maybe some more guidance on what to look out for when considering whether to invest in a fund or not.

I'm looking to passively invest in this fund on a monthly basis.

So-called ESG funds—a growing part of money managing—may not be appropriate for company- sponsored plans, the Labor Department said.

By Sarah Krouse

Funds focused on issues like board diversity, climate change and labor rights are one of the fastest-growing areas of the money management world. But the Labor Department this week warned that these investments may not be appropriate for company-sponsored savings plans.

So-called ESG funds, which take environmental, social and governance factors into account when investing, have been touted by financial executives as a growth opportunity across Wall Street. Assets invested in these types of funds grew to $95 billion in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc., up nearly 60% from the prior year.

While that represents a tiny slice of industrywide assets today, firms are marketing ESG as a bankable trend. Getting such products into retirement plans is considered an important step that would enable money managers to gain a steady flow of investor cash that is likely to stay in funds for a long time. Few 401(k) plans —just 2.4%—o er such ESG funds as an investment option today, according to research on more than 500 such plans by the Plan Sponsor Council of America, a trade group for employer retirement plans.

The Labor Department issued a notice this week, however, that could damp the prospects of so-called ESG funds in retirement accounts.
The department, which oversees 401(k) plans, said in a new bulletin that America’s companies “must not too readily treat ESG factors as economically relevant” to investing choices.
“It does not ineluctably follow from the fact that an investment promotes ESG factors, or that it arguably promotes positive general market trends or industry growth, that the investment is a prudent choice for retirement or other investors,” the department wrote in its guidance. Employers that o er 401(k) plans must act, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as so-called fiduciaries, or in the best interests of participants. The Labor Department periodically issues guidance on how that law is applied.

In recent years, the department has issued guidance that said employers o ering 401(k) plans must not put their own social goals ahead of the financial interests of savers or take on more risk or settle for lower returns in the name of advancing environmental or social causes. But the most recent guidance goes further, by telling plan sponsors and money managers not to give too much weight to those factors as risks or return drivers.

In its bulletin this week the Labor Department said plans’ investment policy guidelines don’t necessarily have to cover ESG factors, and even if they do, money managers don’t always have to comply with them. Plan fiduciaries including investment managers should not spend too much money on shareholder issues or initiating proxy fights, it added.

The notice also made it less likely that ESG-focused target-date funds will become default investment choices in 401(k) retirement savings plans. Target-date funds tailor the risks of their investments to a saver’s expected retirement date and many plans automatically channel their employees into a certain product unless they opt out. A company choosing an ESG-themed fund that appeals to its policy preferences “without regard to possibly di erent or competing views of plan participants and beneficiaries” would raise compliance questions, the Labor Department said.

Some advocates of ESG investing said the guidance marked a shi  in tone for the department.

Fiona Reynolds, chief executive of the United Nations- backed Principles for Responsible Investment, said the guidance “could generate unnecessary confusion” and said “no one should doubt the benefits of ESG integration.”

I do think that social responsibility broadly is a way to sell product when it comes to investing.

More power to you in thinking about using your money this way.

ESG investing has been around for decades but has grown a lot over the last few years. There are more options than ever. 

There are decisions you should make when thinking about investing this way. What are the ESG factors that are important to you in determining you'll invest in a company? Because there (so far) there aren't universal standards across the finance industry as to what is ESG or isn't. Do your research to understand what factors an ESG fund considers.

1. I mostly invest in ETFs that have ESG criteria. SPYX is the SP500 excluding companies with fossil fuel reserves. It has outperformed VOO over the last 5 years. It still includes lots of not great companies that fail on other ESG criteria. (It still includes tobacco companies, gun manufacturers, companies with bad labor practices)

2. When I invest in individual companies I choose to invest in ones that do follow good ESG principles and they make me plenty of money. I currently am invested in CRM, MSFT, DIS and HBI. 

Here's an overview of ESG investing from the Financial Times that you might find useful:

79cknw,dp0wj42,dvdmovie1,"No. There are a number of ESG mutual funds that are varying degrees of mediocre/terrible - some with surprising AUM - and the only thing that I can think of is that people are more concerned with feeling good about their investments than doing well. Parnassus is ESG and a couple of their funds are good/very good. Eventide is ESG and not bad.

But I guess really don't like ESG investment products because it's really a label and not a very well-defined one. I see things in ESG funds that are more than a little questionable. I've written Parnassus questioning a particular investment given the fund's note that investments ""must offer outstanding workplaces"" and wasn't really satisfied by the response - not that I expected the fund to sell something because of what I said or anything, not by any means - but I thought the situation with the company should have lead them to question it. It didn't.

I do direct my investments towards things that I do believe in fairly often and I think science and innovation are certainly a focus, especially when it comes to improving people's daily lives. The investment has to make sense at the end of the day, but those are often a focus. But I'll invest in things like STZ. For me it becomes can I make a well-defined investment case for the stock? Does it have all the aspects I'm looking for in a business?

TLDR: No.",esg
79cknw,dp16d7l,,"I invest in ESG funds. Fidelity has 2 new mutual funds​ with good ER. Vanguard has one domestic, and there are lots of ETFs.  Slightly higher expense ratios (.12 to .5 for the ones I have). For me, I don't want to retire off of the profits of companies I despise.  It's worth the ~0.1-2 % difference in my annual return . My portfolio gets heavier in individual stocks as time goes on, so ERs become less of an issue.

79cknw,dp1i7ra,,"Yes. Initially I was in broad market index funds, then ETFs, but didn’t want to be invested in oil, tobacco, guns, etc. So I transitioned to mostly ESG/Green ETFs (XEN.TO, ESGD, ESGE, and CRBN, with smaller investments in PZD and QCLN).

But there were still companies included that were investing in companies or industries I didn’t care for — and companies with poor fundamentals are included in most indexes. So I went through indexes and selected specific companies with acceptably high ESG ratings and good fundamentals (with the exception of TSLA, which may be my ruin).

My company pension fund — which supports boomers, Gen-Xers, and eventually us Millennials — also has a lot invested in LOWC and CRBN as well as pretty strict criteria on what investments can be included.",esg

Negative screening is a common application of Environmental/Social/Governance (ESG) investing. It avoids “sin stocks” and divests from industries or firms deemed immoral or having poor or undesirable standards along one of the three E, S or G dimensions.  

It’s promoted largely on the fact that it’s virtuous. While we may all define virtue differently, advocating for it in this way is fair and appropriate. However, employing these constraints is also often promoted as enhancing expected returns. That is, if you avoid certain companies, industries, and even countries, that are deemed non-virtuous, you should expect to make more money over time. Do good and make the same return or more! This is mostly wrong and, more the point here, actually at odds with the very point of ESG investing. 

Pursuing virtue should hurt expected returns. Some have discussed this fact. But, it’s still not widely understood or broadly accepted. This seems to arise from investment managers selling virtue as a free lunch, and from investors who very much want to believe in that story. 

In particular, and my focus here, accepting a lower expected return is not just an unfortunate ancillary consequence to ESG investing, it’s precisely the point (though its necessity may indeed be unfortunate). **As an ESG investor this lower expected return is exactly what you want to happen and really the only way you can effect the change you seek**.

There's really not a lot of money in businesses that run on good feelings and are heavily commoditized.  CALPERS (California pension system) is heavily invested in these kinds of things.  Not only has the entire pension fund underperformed and it's only 65% funded, but their worst performing funds all happen to be in these categories.

8bhhrp,dx6r15l,JustAsIgnorantAsYou,"This is a pretty unpopular opinion here, but I do care about what the companies I own do. I probably wouldn't invest in tobacco or any of the major arms manufacturers that has been involved in corruption scandals. 

But these socially responsible funds that they try to sell people really don't make a lot of sense to me. Anybody who thinks oil production is immoral should try to go a year without exploiting any petroleum in any form whatsoever and see how that goes. Consumption has a much larger effect on corporate behavior than small shareholders do, so to use something but not want to invest in it for moral reasons seems a bit ridiculous. ",esg
8bhhrp,dx6q53y,drubs,"I wish it was more popular and easier. A lot of funds that advertise themselves as ESG have some questionable holdings. It’s hard to really come up with a firm definition for ESG that people can agree on. Plus our economy is so interconnected that it’s hard to truly avoid some things. 

I’m very sensitive to the idea of making money from companies I consider unethical / a detriment to society. I really want to avoid making money from fossil fuels, but there’s a great deal of impracticality to that if you want anything even resembling a reasonably balanced portfolio. 

Cheap energy (mostly in the form of fossil fuels) is such an important part of the modern economy that just trying to avoid owning oil, gas, and coal companies doesn’t really address the crux of the climate change issue either. I do try to focus on finding companies / funds that are investing for a low/no carbon future. I think that’s the best we can really hope to do for the time being. ",esg

8bhhrp,dx6uzb5,KevinMcCallister,"Generally I think if you really care about ESG sorts of companies and investing, you have to be willing to take a hit on returns. But, IMO, that is entirely OK. Especially if it makes you feel good and you truly believe what you are doing is right. I think that is worth something in terms of real $$ -- as a result, if you believe in it and feel good about it, then to an extent I think you should ignore the underperformance and take the psychological or moral ""returns"" as the real ""profit."" On top of this I think there are still some real questions about very long-term returns -- I don't think it is entirely outside the realm of possibility that some ESG companies are taking hits now when in 20, 30, or 40 years they may be making much quicker strides than competitors due their progressive policies.

gvgcnc,fsps6hn,Unlucky-Prize,"Based on your definition of ESG, I think you are going to struggle to find large companies that don't do something you find objectionable, because as corporate activities increase, that possibility increases. Ultimately, we run on a capitalist system, and the functioning of a capitalist system is to maximize capital efficiency, which tends to produce things like paying CEOS a lot of money. It also tends to produce a lot of wealth. Lots of CEOs are delighted to be making tens of millions a year, and also care deeply about humanity and act upon that. Some, like Warren Buffet and Gates, are basically leaving all of their money to charity. Your views are kind of unipolar and don't accept that there are inevitably tradeoffs in any system grounded in the scarcity of the real world. There's no publicly traded company that both lacks some measure of good and bad deeds.  Except for Herbalife. They are just bad.

But to the extent you aren't going to modify your views, I have three suggestions:

First, you could simply go through and take all of the major sectors (it's 11), and for each sector, pick 1-3 companies you think are the best (despite their flaws), and invest. That'll give you vaguely correlated to index performance.  Then, make sure your weighting is proportional to the overall sector weighting. So for example, if you go to Health Care (14.9%), you could decide you like Gilead and Anthem, but don't like J&J or United Health or the rest. Or whatever. You will have to go in knowing you will dislike some of the things they are doing, but also know that you are rewarding the ones that fit your definition of ESG with higher valuations (on the margins, unless you are a multi-billionaire).

Secondly, you could just buy the normal indexes, and donate to causes you feel are worthy to 'offset' the things you don't like making money from.

Thirdly, you could pick sectors where you are less concerned, and accept worse diversification. Real Estate in particular has pretty good internal diversification, and offers a pretty broad set of business models, and tends to be a lot more by the book. There are also some real estate companies that specifically have a business around building out housing inventory in distressed urban areas.",esg

esniay,ffbt65t,dvdmovie1,"""e.g the companies with a female CEO""

I'm not going to ever invest in a company simply because it has a female CEO. There are female CEOs who are not good (Ginni Rometty at IBM, for example.) There are very good female CEOs (Mandy Ginsberg of Match, Sarah Friar was effectively CEO of Square and should have been made CEO - she was fantastic there, I don't own it but Lisa Su of AMD is another example; there was a great female CEO at INGR who turned the company around and then she left and the stock went South) I'm looking for *good* CEOs, whether they are female or male.

""investing in green companies""

I'm not going to invest in green businesses because they are green. Something I find very irritating is the view that ""it's green and therefore it must be good."" People said ""it's solar so it must be good"" a lot about SunEdison right into bankruptcy.  There were shareholders of that company who spent a ridiculous amount of money on legal fees to create a shareholder committee because they thought the bankruptcy process was being used to ""steal the company from them."" There are letters to the judge that show no comprehension of the possibility that it was a shitty fucking company, but only that it was solar so therefore it was ""saving the planet."" Those people lost twice: they lost on the stock and they lost money on a legal battle there was no way on earth they'd ever win. 

I'm certainly not against investing in green companies, but it has to be something that I feel checks all the boxes that I'd use when looking at anything else and solar panels (for example) just don't do that - there is no moat. So I'm certainly not against, but I definitely don't think that something green is automatically a good business. I look at ""green"" companies like I'd look at anything else and either it checks the boxes and I'll consider investing or it doesn't.

I have started to much more look at workplace reviews in the last year and factored that more into decision making.

""companies with ethical governance""

I don't think people in this era really seem to care that much about strong corporate governance. ESG investing is big absolutely but I really do think that there is a portion of younger people that care a lot about the E and the S but not the G.

Additionally, MSCI certainly continues to see benefit in the growth from ESG but nobody talks about investing in ESG in that sense.

I also think their days are numbered, as soon as wireless high-speed internet or fiber is available, people are going to switch. The technology shift and cord-cutting itself was fueled by their behavior.

In order to invest in a company, I have to believe in something about it-- that could be culture, a product, underlying value, or an industry. For example, more than a meme stock, SPCE represents a real push forward towards a worthy human endeavor (improving technology and developing industry related to space exploration and hypersonic travel). PINS is something I really enjoyed using, though I do not have a current use case for it. NET is part of why DDOS feels like it is no longer a big issue. 

I do not care about enforcing ""diversity"" through my investments-- because it is not my cause and I am not convinced that there is any real benefit. I think it may undermine the credibility of women and minorities who are on BODs. I would rather have slower, but real progress, than create a new class of token director. 

There are a million causes in the world, and I think people without a real cause or purpose gravitate towards the zeitgeist.

I think you are exaggerating this a bit. I only saw one comment where you got massively downvoted and lots of people did honestly reply to your post overall.

The one time I did see you catch the major downvotes was because someone pointed out that your overall question is about ethical investing but one of the examples you gave for it was investing in a company just because it has a women CEO, which on it's face isn't ethical or unethical but rather pretty dumb and a bit sexist. You then tried to pivot and argue it falls under personal preference, but that has nothing to do with your original question of ethical investing which is why you were rightfully downvoted in that one instance.

Anyway, answering your actual question, no I don't participate in ethical investing as almost all of my holdings are in broad index funds so I have lots of companies who's overall mission statement/business practices I don't agree with.

The filter will not be literally the filter that you would apply personally - e.g. I'm invested in the one I mention above but for some reason it contains some McDonald's shares which I would rather not have included (some of this can be the result of ""green-washing"" where companies game ESG metrics). If you really want to do things your own way you will have to pick stocks yourself but it will require a lot more effort and attention. So you might need to compromise...

I disagree with the idea that this is necessarily not profitable. The ESG ETFs that I have have shown very similar returns to similar non-ESG ETFs in the last few weeks, for example. Also if you're really thinking long-term I think it makes a lot of sense to choose precisely these kinds of ETFs because the companies included in them are likely to be a bit more sustainable in the long run. Jeremy Grantham is one famous investor who has expressed that you should consider environmental sustainability because a lot is going to change (the world might look very different for oil companies in 30 years, for example), which I think makes a lot of sense.

Personally I find it unacceptable to not consider ethics at all while choosing your investments. Sure, people will tell you investing is just about money and you're an idiot to not just chase profit, and you should change your consumption behavior rather than choose your investments. I think this is nonsense - investments do affect companies, even if it's just a bit (e.g. makes it easier for them to fund operations), and something which I think is highly underappreciated in many of these discussions is how being invested in certain companies might cause certain conflicts of interest for yourself.

2.	The overall movement toward SRI is staggering, with claims that we could hot 50% of US investments in 2050. This is relevant for two reasons:
a. Shifting indices means companies need to tick different boxes, impacting on KPIs etc. No small matter.
b. With more money invested in ESG funds, both active and passive investment funds will start engaging on the issues selected for those funds. This puts direct pressure on management in companies.
3.	Companies scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of ESG present a clear and present danger to markets as a whole. The recognition of this risk by index fund managers as relevant to their mid-term positions as universal investors (i.e. investors that cannot exit the market) is part of their shifting position on ESG.

EDIT: Ethical considerations are important to me, but my position is flexible and nuanced according to individual companies.

If you don't, ESG just becomes a gimmick label that adds costs and doesn't really reflect your values.

You're paying two ""prices"" that you might not pay in a different fund. First, the expense ratio is high. Not only are they screening for valuable companies, they're also screening for ESG practices that check their boxes.

Any fund with limitations on what it can invest in will inevitably be less profitable than non-limited funds in the long-term. I'm not necessarily saying that funds that don't care about the environment will outperform those that do (although, that is not a crazy hypothesis), but instead I'm saying that forcing yourself onto a smaller playing field makes you less competitive compared to the funds with more options.

I wish this sub had more discussions on the topic as many investors like you do indeed struggle to find a path. it is commendable that you are thinking about this and not simply following the herd.

That being said, ESG ETFs aren't as mature as their counterparts and often have substantial tracking differences. You should always check that first. ESGV is relatively young and I personally do not like ETFs that are younger than 3 years. The performance you mentioned captures a 'rally - dip - rally' period of the stock market. This is a very tiny sample.

Personally I couldn't find an ESG ETF with a TD I was comfortable with (note i am in the EU), so I took a more difficult path:

1. I pick stocks and I will probably under-perform the S&P but that's ok as long I beat inflation.
2. I pick sector based ETFs after careful analysis of which companies are listed in.
3. I am currently looking into Factor based ETFs that capture ESG companies since these companies tend to exhibit different factors during different market regime.

However, Pepsi has been more successful in sparkling water with Bubly and Sodastream, although it can be argued that something like Bubly has not a whole lot of moat. La Croix had its fad time in the spotlight and was obliterated by larger, more powerful competitors with stronger distribution networks who saw the demand for sparkling water.

I don't own Coke, simply because I just don't find the business interesting.

Additionally, nothing against Coke but I would rather invest in innovative healthcare than something that isn't good for people.

Many ESG funds also just aren't very good, but I think as long as people believe that they are doing something ""green"" or similar that they are going to be more forgiving of the mediocre performance. Additionally, just because something is ""green"" does not guarantee that it will be a good investment - that's something I've said on here for years now. Many people think that ""green"" automatically means a good investment but that simply isn't the case - just because something is green doesn't mean that people don't have to be discerning and do their research as to whether it's a good investment or not.

Lastly, something might not be 100% sustainable (I think trying to find something 100% is going to be severely limiting to your universe of possible investments), but look at something like Ecolab (ECL), which is the largest hygiene/sanitation company. It's not sexy, it's not exciting, but it's something that many companies need day in/day out and therefore, there's a lot of recurring revenue. They are also helping customers with tasks like reducing water use. Bill Gates owns about 12%.  

A company like Waste Management is consistently improving their recycling process and innovating with things like using landfill gas (https://www.wm.com/sustainability/renewable-energy.jsp; ""At about 130 disposal sites, we use naturally-occurring landfill gas to power homes and businesses. Just recently, we even developed the technology to convert landfill gas into a fuel our fleet vehicles can run on."")  Again, not a sexy business but the idea being they can do more and more each year with the waste that they get every day.

Calvert Research and Management, the sustainability powerhouse owned by Eaton Vance (EV), compiled *Barron’s* list, basing the rankings on hundreds of metrics that address environmental, social, and corporate governance, or ESG, factors.

(...)

To create the rankings, Calvert analyzed the 1,000 largest publicly held U.S. companies (by stock market value) and scored them on more than 200 key indicators and 28 issues. Calvert then sorted the data into five key categories: shareholders, employees, customers, planet, and community. (The shareholders category might include executive compensation, for example, and the customers category might include data security or product safety.) Each corporation received a rating from zero to 100 in each category. Finally, Calvert produced a single rating for all of the companies, weighted according to how material each category is for their industry: Emissions are less critical for a bank’s score than they are for a trucking company’s, for example. It also excluded companies that didn’t meet the [Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment](https://www.calvert.com/the-calvert-principles.php?mod=article_inline).

Institutions have major impacts on the business because companies have legal obligations to serve the interests of investors. Which is only because law firms at the behest of major capital funds bought huge stakes in companies and then sued said companies to maximize shareholder returns(that is literally the playbook of all those ""corporate raiders"" during the 80's). Berkshire Hathaway is literally called that because buffet got pissed at the previous owner so he bought the Stocks of the company, fires the previous owner, and turned a textile manufacture into a major insurance company. 


Institutions can buy up stock in a company with the specific intent to change how the company operates. Usually that only happens in the sense of changing the company to make more money for the already wealthy. When it comes to actual social justice it's far *far* more difficult to enact change. Mainly because systems of power Don't like being applied to help those without power(e.g the people who would benefit from social justice). 

Like in the state of New York tried to use it's shareholder power to force Exxon to set internal CO2 reductions. That was blocked by the federal government (I want to say the SEC but it might have been another department). Limiting fossil fuel emissions doesn't make the right people rich so it isn't permitted. 

That's just one institution. The idea goes back to the 60's. Like MLK Jr advocating economic withdraw from companies that didn't improve their race relations. If he had not been assassinated the very next day that probably would have had a notable impact.",esg

I invest to make money too. I plan to retire in my early 40s, and like the idea of not living the rest of my life off the profits of companies I despise.  News flash: You can be 90% more socially responsible by dropping 10% of the companies out of your portfolio.  Anyone who knows much about indexing should understand that this will have a negligible impact on returns. 

Socially responsible investing is not about investing in shitty solar panel companies or compostable forks.  It's just about excluding the most deplorable from your portfolio. It's easy, it doesn't cost much money, and it doesn't cost much in returns.   Average expense ratios are a bit higher than giant index funds because of lower assets under management, but still lower than average funds. 

I mostly invest in individual stocks, but for foreign allocation it's difficult so I invest in FNIRX (Fidelity International Sustainability Index Fund).  It's a new family of funds, but it seems to track major foreign indexes pretty closely.  This particular fund has 856 holdings with a 0.25% expense ratio. I am hopeful it will go down a bit as AUM goes up.  Those funds are market cap weighted and just try to exclude companies that score bad on SRI/ESG metrics.   I also have some in MPCT (iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF). This one tracks ""UN sustainable development goals"" and weights companies based on their impact.  It has a 0.49% expense raito, 97 holdings and is beating VT(Vanguard total market) for the year. 

Funds to check out (depending on your brokerage / etc):    
iShares market weight ETFs: ESGU (US ), ESGD (Developed), ESGE (Emerging)  
iShares other ETFs SUSA, DSI, MPCT  
Fidelity MFs: FPNSX (US), FNIRX (international)

That's all cash money in Nintendo's pocket, plus they haven't even announced their inevitable Smash Bros. re-release.

Other publishers are making big money off of loot box style purchases, but all it takes is for California to designate that as gambling and suddenly that business model doesn't work anymore; there's a very non-zero chance of that happening with Hawaii already getting the ball rolling.  These other publishers have also doubled down on the loot box strategy for only a handful of titles per year, meaning that they don't have much of a safety net if loot boxes can't continue to be used into the future.

As we pollute the atmosphere the amount of direct energy from the sun to the surface will be reduced because the air is thicker and because of more cloud cover, making it harder for solar panels to pick up those rays.

However since the atmosphere is thicker it absorbs more energy from the sun overall(greenhouse effect). This leads a hotter climate and a lot more precipitation/wind. Therefore the worse climate change becomes the more energy we can get directly from the wind.

Strategy
The Parnassus Endeavor Fund invests with low turnover and high conviction in approximately 30 holdings. The Fund focuses on identifying companies with:

Wide moats or strong competitive advantages that protect market share and profitability

Quality management teams that will act in the best interest of shareholders

Favorable three-year investment horizon

The Fund invests in large-capitalization companies that represent Parnassus' clearest expression of ESG investing: portfolio companies must offer outstanding workplaces, and must not be engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing, or refining of fossil fuels. This workplace focus can result in significant exposure to technology companies, many of which are leaders in offering positive and innovative workplaces.

Edit:

Here's a review of literature on the subject for anyone who's interested in more information: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=985267. Table 5 summarizes the findings. It looks like alphas are generally the same (not significantly different) as non-SRI. ",esg
6u0fiv,dlq7lwx,Teddy125,"Just had a conversation with people @ ISS about ESG. There are two reason for the current shift on focusing on ESG.

1. The younger investors asking for it.  

2. Shift to passive. When the PMs have to hold a stock because it is in an index, there are no major ownership decision they need to make.  So the proxy process is where they have something to say. Especially in ESG.

I have read somewhere awhile back, sin funds does much better than socially responsible funds. 

",esg
3tbog1,cx4yapj,cb_hanson,"The returns cited in the first bullet point seem to come from a recent study from some HBS academics. They find that there is around 5-6% difference in annual alpha (so risk adjusted performance) between the high and low sustainability firms, which I find quite interesting.

The caveat is that the results seem quite volatile. You can see this in the graph. The high sustainability firms crashed hard during the financial crisis, but have recently performed very well. But in the first 5-6 years of the sample, there was no difference between the two portfolios.

Also there is no clear indication whether this fund can practically implement the approach used in the study or how closely they will follow it. The study results don't seem to include transactions costs nor give an indication of how much turnover there is in the portfolios (at least in my very quick read).

Finally the difference between high and low portfolios may not mean that much to you if your benchmark is say the broad market. The performance of the high portfolio versus the market may be optically much less impressive (although of course they do control for market risk when calculating alphas).

Edit: Also keep in mind that the HBS study gives in-sample results (like most other studies). The authors likely tried many different definitions of sustainability in order to get a nice spread between high and low. (I'm not singling out the authors - everyone does it.) You should expect the out-of-sample results to be materially lower. ",esg

There's some logic to the idea that being a ""good company"" keeps you off the front page of the WSJ for the wrong reasons, which in turn exposes you to unwanted risk and volatility. Plus there are arguments to make about discouraging short-termism in your corporate culture and things of that nature, if your investment horizon is sufficiently long.

The big problem historically has been in how to define ESG factors in a standardizable way. There have been some attempts to do this, like the above study, but good governance is in the end a much more qualitative metric than anything you can extract from the accounting statements.

Personally I would say that ESG has some value as part of a qualitative overlay. I would not use it as part of my universe selection process, nor would I make it my only qualitative criterion. Basically I think it's best as part of a ""regular active portfolio that cares a bit about ESG"" rather than a ""ESG portfolio"".",esg

Beware ... this field is full of marketing gobbledegook and straight up bullshit. Everyone talks about ""embedding ESG/CSR"" into business process and functions so that it becomes ""core,"" but in the end, all the resources directed towards it are in some dark corner of HR or some bullshit caused-based marketing scheme.

I am in. Let's go. Will be buying both shares, to receive the dividend, and $12 1/15 calls for the upside.  Just as a friendly for everyone thinking of buying call options - you DON'T receive the dividend for owning call options, and the dividend amount being paid is $0.72 per share, which means on 9/22, the share price immediately falls $0.72 per share to start the day because it goes ex-dividend (not counting whatever happens on trading, etc.).

You forgot the potential for Goro Mine in New Caledonia. Their deal with NCZ fell through recently, but their site also doesn’t completely rule out another deal, saying it would go on care and maintenance unless another deal could be struck in the coming months.

This also goes along with the snake jazz / Polynesian elevator music outside of the cars. New Caledonia is just OUTSIDE of the Polynesian islands. It’s actually a French territory which would get them around EU ethical mining laws. However, there’s an October 4th vote for independence, and another in 2022 that could change that. They could use the mine, or sell it to shore up their balance sheet further.

September 16th, 2020 by Dr. Maximilian Holland 
Tesla Battery Day is less than a week away. In my view, most Tesla commentary continues to overlook what is already known when it comes to predictions for what will be revealed on Tesla Battery Day.
Update: Elon Musk has responded to this article:

While there will no doubt be exciting showcase technology and plenty of “one more thing” elements, Elon Musk has probably already revealed the main battery tech that will enable Tesla to massively scale its mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy (and transport).
I analysed and explained my take on this news immediately after it broke during the Tesla 2020 Q2 earning call in July, but it seems a significant portion of Tesla chatter has simply missed it or, more likely, not understood it.
Not everyone knows that LFP battery packs are at least 20% cheaper per kWh than nickel-based battery packs, and that LFP cathodes have no mineral supply constraints or price spikes (unlike nickel cells). But when you do know that, and if you heard what Elon said, it adds up to something very significant.

What did Elon say?

So let’s break it down once more. Here is what Elon already said in the Q2 call for those who didn’t catch it the first time around (this time with italics):
“The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at an affordable price, that’s the real limit, so that’s why we’re going to talk a lot more about this on battery day, because this is the fundamental scaling constraint.”
“There’s two general classes of cell, there’s iron phosphate [LFP] and then the nickel based. Nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer range obviously those are needed for something like the Semi where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo. So it’s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack.
“However, what we’re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough that we actually are comfortable having an LFP pack in Model 3 in China, and that will be in volume production later this year. So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200s… you probably get a range of almost 300 miles, with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.” Elon Musk, 2020 Q2 Tesla earnings call.

I have written about the economics and properties of LFP cells and nickel-cobalt cells for electric vehicles several times (check here, here, and here), so maybe I have a different perspective from most Tesla watchers. The interpretation of Elon Musk’s statements seems unambiguous to me. But even simple words are open to different interpretations, so I’ll spell out my interpretation here:
There are lots of varieties of electrochemistry, but currently there are only two main commercial pathways for EV cells, LFP (iron phosphate–based cathodes) and nickel (nickel cobalt–based cathodes). This is widely understood within the industry. So far, so good.
The higher energy density of nickel-cobalt cells (compared to LFP) is well suited to long-range, weight-sensitive electric vehicles like the Tesla Semi. However (in contrast) for Tesla passenger vehicles (especially the entry level vehicles not needing 400+ miles of range, or crazy power-to-weight performance ratios), Tesla’s many years of accumulating powertrain and other efficiencies mean that even the more modest energy density of LFP is now sufficient to give almost 300 miles of range.
Add in the crucial side note (that Elon knows very well but most of the Tesla community apparently does not) that LFP EV batteries are much cheaper per kWh and much more scalable (raw material availability) than nickel ones.",esg

If not, the reporters and  media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon  Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses  must at least appear as if they are environmentally “sensitive"".

For all your DD, you seem to have completely missed that Vale is responsible for two of the biggest environmental disasters in Brazil's recent history—the [Brumadinho dam disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumadinho_dam_disaster) and the [Mariana dam disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster)—which, in addition to causing humanitarian crises, killed nearly 300 people. And its all because they're too fucking cheap and lazy to build dams that aren't total pieces of shit. Their former CEO is being tried for homicide, along with 15 other Vale employees—and this amidst a hyper-conservative administration that's chummy with big mining.

If Musk really wants a sustainable, environmentally conscious mining partner, Vale isn't it. And if he goes with them, there will almost certainly be public blowback. Maybe it won't matter. But I suspect that if there were any partnership announced, the [US Network for Democracy in Brazil](https://www.democracybrazil.org/portfolio) would chomp at the bit. It would be an easy, high profile campaign.

Edit: Wait. Hold up. In all seriousness, I think you may have overlooked one thing. I know I may sound like a retard since I don't do nearly as much DD as I should, but isn't Tesla's whole business model about vertical integration? - From my basic understanding, that would mean they try to keep as much as possible in house. Like with their battery production. Panasonic is a means to an ends, eventually I'd imagine the goal would be is to move away from them and build it themselves. If not, acquire a company which does it and build on that. Wouldn't vertical integration mean that at some point in time, while trying to improve efficiencies and reduce overall costs, the next big cost reduction would come from mining the nickel themselves?  They might have a deal with them, but I don't think a deal would be the same as a partnership.

So keep in mind that on battery day (9/22/20) the share price will adjust $0.428 lower because that is the Ex-Dividend date. So essentially for the 9/25 exp calls the first 3% - 4% gain is required to get you back to even. So when considering the price of the options right now basically think about it like the current price is actually: current price - $0.43 so about $11.25 right now.

Shares of **Village Farms International** (NASDAQ: VFF) were soaring 22.6% as of 3:50 p.m. EDT on Friday. The cannabis and greenhouse produce company didn't announce any news of its own, but there were several other developments that were likely behind Village Farms' big gain.

One potential factor for the Village Farms' jump was Statistics Canada's release Friday morning of data showing that cannabis sales in Canada skyrocketed in March. Also, results from a study were announced on Thursday that found that some cannabis strains could help prevent the novel coronavirus from entering host cells. In addition, Bank of America reinstated coverage on big cannabis producer **Canopy Growth** (NYSE: CGC) with a buy rating, which could be viewed as a positive sign for the entire Canadian cannabis industry.

“I believe we will, but we didn't get it done this last session because it's a complicated issue and it has to be done in a comprehensive way, ” Cuomo said during a Friday press conference. 

Cuomo also said it was the federal government's obligation to financially aid the city at this time. Just as the airline and hotel industries are getting assistance, so should the city's health care workers, he said. 

Cuomo added that he was in favor of marijuana legalization and affirmed that he had worked arduously to pass that into law for years, but ultimately without success.

The company also said the Nasdaq was a better fit given that exchange's emphasis on environmental, social, and governmental (ESG) principles.

ixhgi6,g67fndd,TheseInevitable,Very interesting take. It is questioning that most banks and asset managers invest significantly in the ESG teams. These people have not prove to add any value for the investors but a green marketing touch.,esg
ixhgi6,g6x2q8x,HughLaurieGreg,"I found this really interesting as well. Innovation in measurement and reporting looks to be the key to truly understanding ESG success and seeing how it correlates w returns.

At the moment ESG ratings firms are stimied by the fact that they’re rating based on limited disclosures by companies and also disclosure on what’s easy to quantify. Of course these firms then put out scores w differences in rating opinion.

It is difficult to strive towards something without knowing where to go. And that hurts both management and investors interested in including an ethical perspective into their mission statement and could lead down the path of greenwashing.",esg
ixhgi6,g7d7luj,esgmachine,"Somewhat relevant, but another issue with ESG is that managers can't even quantitatively measure ESG preferences of clients. Here is a tool for measuring ESG preferences created by an MIT research group.

It is a quick 3 minute game and gives you a numerical measure of ESG preferences.",esg
ixhgi6,g68qo3o,bananarepubliccat,"The whole premise of ESG is that people who work in asset management just sit around, smoking cigars, wondering how they can rape the environment or sell orphaned children into slavery.

If an asset manager adopts ESG they either do no research themselves (i.e. any normal research process should turn up long-term negative stuff like pollution) or they are doing it for marketing (the market for ESG is admittedly growing rapidly and comprised of unusually stupid investors).

But there is no difference between profit and social good (and externalities are clearly the responsibility of govt, not companies). And even if there was, there is no way to assign a ""morality score"". For example, I would regard Facebook as a company which appears to habitually do things which has very negative societal consequences but ESG always focuses on things which can be easily quantified (like carbon emissions) which are far less the product of wilfully negative behaviour (for example, most O&G companies are fueling essentially all transport...that isn't negative).",esg
j660bs,g8adfz9,mm4biz,"I'm going to say something that may be a bit controversial or rub some of you the wrong way, so please don't overreact. I'm just sharing an opinion.

My view on reading investor letters is that they are a complete waste of time. This is a bit of a skeptical view, but I believe none of these funds ever share their best ideas in these letters. Those timely or great ideas are often shared with their LPs privately via e-mail, meetings, or calls. They know that the letters leak, and so there really is no wisdom to giving away free information to competitors. We have to remember that just like any other business, competition matters in asset management and nobody really wants to share \*valuable\* information with their competitors especially in a sector where informational advantage is so important.

Now some letters contain ""a window into the manager's thinking"" or a particular ""framework"" or ""mental model"" or whatever you want to call it for how these managers supposedly make decisions.  Again, I'm going to say something unpopular here which is that most of what they write is for them to signal or show that there is a logical sensible pattern to how they invest and that there is a methodical ""process"", which is something that LPs look for. So more so than anything else, sharing this type of thinking is for marketing purposes. Also noteworthy is that they don't necessarily operate on these frameworks all the time themselves - there is a lot of deviation, opportunistic stuff they do, etc, but they're not going to put that down in writing.  Those also happen to be where they generate the most alpha.

In my view, in any line of business, the information that really matters is never shared widely. That's why these letters to me are not so valuable, even though they seem to be written so well and with such clarity of thought and logical foundation that they leave the reader mesmerized and in awe.",esg

jgtf1h,g9sfzbe,FulcrumSecurity,"I invested in a few very small coal mines through private equity transactions and don’t cover the public space but have a bit of a perspective from that experience. Simply put, our thesis was coal is going away eventually but not as quickly as expected. There are certain captive markets where power plants were built and then retrofitted with hundreds of millions of dollars of emissions capturing/sulfur scrubbing improvements and could only consume the coal produced in the region because of transportation and the electricity is supplied to markets where the grid would become less stable if this source of power were to go away.

A few points:
- Melting ice cube plays like this are rightfully highly tied to cash flow today. So when gas prices dropped and coal prices followed this created a huge hit to value. You also don’t get any uplift from interest rates falling because there’s no multiple expansion benefit for an industry that can conceivably go to zero in the medium term.
- Low natural gas prices forever became the base case when making decisions around decommissioning of power plants. While in the past one may have justified operating coal plants at a higher cost vs natural gas plants for the sake of diversification and cyclical nature of nat gas prices the ESG push away from coal made it easier not to point out a scenario where gas prices rise. Even with higher gas prices I think you’d need years of observations of coal being more cost effective before its ever considered. If not for such a strong ESG case the sunk costs of installing upgrades would have made it untenable to decommission a coal plant 20 years ahead of its useful life but it’s become clear it’s worth it.
- On grid stability California made it clear they don’t care if they have brownouts they’d rather have a less reliable grid than import power from coal.
- When industries are dying/have major ESG concerns costs go up. The cost of capital goes up because lenders need extra compensation to deal with the questions that arise. Labor gets more difficult to find and more expensive because nobody sees it as a long term career. Insurance goes up because a shrinking industry isn’t worth the time to focus on. Equipment stops being produced and replacement parts go up in price and repairs get more costly as all of the businesses previously addressing that market go under.

Edit: All this is to say I think I’d be interested in buying a coal mine equity if it has no leverage and a 30% current dividend yield.",esg
jgtf1h,g9sd0p6,Turbomattk,Nope. Coal is now more expensive than other forms of energy. It isn't coming back unless we are in a dystopian society.,esg
jgtf1h,g9smaw2,lowlyinvestor,"I don't want to talk politics, but coal had one of its biggest cheerleaders sitting in the oval office for the past 3.75 years and still did abysmally. How do you think it will do if/when there is leadership that is actively trying to reduce its usage?

We're moving beyond coal:.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/coal-usage-consumption](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/coal-usage-consumption)

jgtf1h,g9tbusf,ValueScreener,"There are two types of coal. Metallurgical, which is used to make steel, and thermal which is used for energy. Thermal is dead and it’s never coming back. There remains an oversupply, nat gas continues to each market share, and the greenies (environmentalists) are insane about killing thermal coal. Several major insurance companies and banks have agreed not to work with coal producers, this started a few years ago and is picking up steam. This came from environmentalist pressure. 
Coal power plants continue to convert to nat gas... I could go on but you get the point.

Met however has great value. I think contura energy is a pure met play. That’s the only coal company I could get behind. Yes there are other ways to make steel such as arc furnaces etc.. but nothing is as cheap as met coal. The problem is pricing is unpredictable and completely reliant upon steel production. Most of that is done in China which again is unpredictable.

I’d steer clear of thermal coal. Thank me later",esg
jgtf1h,g9sg7lx,chicken_afghani,"Don't sleep on coal completely. Some of these companies pay huge dividend yields, often in ""special"" dividends, so they'll actually show up on websites as having a low dividend yield.

Coal is still today a big part of the energy mix in the U.S. and can't be taken away without nationwide power blackouts. And so coal will sell at a market price at which guarantees suitable profitability for firms to provide enough volume. After waves of bankruptcy, today we have the low cost survivors, for the most part. The lowest cost producers clearly have a price that is attractive and provide a great equity IRR.

The export case for coal is tough because there are super low cost producers in Mongolia and the CCP has built trains directly there.",esg
jgtf1h,g9skzk7,TheDanMan95,"If you look at the premiums you can get by selling options on ARLP, it gets to the point where they’d have to go bankrupt soon for it to not be a good investment. Dec 20 $2.5 puts are about $.20, which gives you an 8% return in 2 months. Jan 2022 calls for $5 are selling at around $.80-.90 as well.

You can pocket a lot of money selling puts, and if you do get assigned, you can sell calls for ~.80. You’d essentially be paying $1.50 to get a $2.50 stock.

Obviously I don’t think the future is super bright for coal, since its share of electricity generation has been declining pretty quickly over the past 10 years. However, it still accounts for over 20% of US power generation, and there’s no way to completely replace that within the next decade.

In the short-medium term (1-3 years), ARLP offers the potential for a pretty substantial spike. It has been profitable for every year of its existence except 2020. Hell, it even earned nearly $3 a share *in 2019 alone*. When demand for power returns to pre-recession levels, I see no reason why it can’t return to profitability again. It has the opportunity to rise significantly once that happens, especially if it resumes distributions.",esg

had5ls,fv2a7v4,DerRook,"u/Valincity Congrats on graduating! I think you did a good job putting the technical skills you learned in school to use. The thing I would push on here would be the story you're trying to tell. The valuation, liquidity, and profitability stuff are all important, but they don't add to anything. I found myself asking ""so what"".

If the big story here is how 5g is going to reshape the telecoms and is a growth opportunity for Verizon, then that should be the focus and the rest should support it.  I didn't see a clear thesis. Some things I think you missed:

* Will 5G cannibalize Verizon's home internet business? If it does do they have better profit margins maintaining a 5G infrastructure instead of a fiber one?
* You're assuming growth based on 4G, but how much of that was driven by the increase in % of people with smart phones? Can you assume the same growth now that 90%+ people already have smart phones? Are there other opportunities  for wireless growth enabled by 5G (internet of things, ...)?",esg
had5ls,fv2yn8r,zaracap,"Congrats on graduation.

You put a lot of technical work in which is great! I think the best way to grasp knowledge you learn from the classroom is to get out there and start making analyses ASAP.

I skimmed over most of it and I have some advice: going forward, try to isolate the key factors driving your thesis and focus on those. I know you probably worked very hard putting all this technical work on paper, but a large portion of this is not really necessary and doesn't add much insight. You may be missing the forest for the trees a bit. 

You would get a MUCH greater return on your time if you get down to the 2-3 variables that truly matter for an investment and digging deep on those. Most often these variables have a qualitative aspect that will infer what ROIIC and reinvestment will look like 5+ years down the line.

In short, I would spend less time calculating 500 different ratios and more time looking at the handful of factors (these differ on a case by case basis) that drive 80% of price movement.

Edit: I should add that it is perfectly fine to look at some of these measures if they help you understand the company and shed light on the key drivers, but when communicating your thesis it is best to triage and focus on what matters most.",esg

FWIW The reason their ROE was so high over the past several years was because they took on a lot of debt to buy out Vodafone (Europe) for the remaining half of Verizon Wireless. Should subtract acquisition costs in addition to capex to determine a more accurate FCF calculation.

 Given their duo-opoly with ATT, you could use a much simpler residual earnings model because that'll help capture more of the investment value of 5G (assuming you go back to the financial statements and capitalize a portion of their R&D).

Also, I think your thesis should focus on whether the FCF is sustainable given the backdrop of persistent falling demand for coal in the US. Also, from a capital allocation perspective, you have to consider whether it is prudent to pay out dividends using the FCF (instead of paying down debt/acquisitions etc).

Now, the other ""D"" is ALSO PAID FOR IN CASH. You add it back b/c univeral acceptance and comparison makes sense in terms of multiples. It doesn't add fucking value to the company b/c it's an incremental adjustment to a non-GAAP earnings metric.

My own level is quite low but I find this engaging all the same.

At what level are you going to map the path dependency of the structure?

This isn't my actual field, but I dabbled a bit for my grad thesis(dynamic hedging of options structures). 

What really makes me nervous is the discontinuity at the barrier of the structure and so the manager is going to hedge along those lines. 

So a barrier for 100calls /KO 98 could go from ,66delta to zero. So a seller would be rather sad if he is filled north of 98. The delta, I gather, reflect this. Where a vanilla delta would sit at say 50, the knock-out would express 66 or 68, or so. (guess) Thus there is a balance between delta accumulation and it being superfluous. 

The transaction costs of unwinding the structure would definitely have a premium to them. (duh)

If asked, I would assume that the forward would be priced with some sort of drift.. So an upward sloping forward curve would equate to higher call deltas. Downward for put.

There actual competent people as my babbling is likely worthless. 

Meucci has a text on risk allocation. There should be something in there for mapping events.

Taleb would definitely have addressed it in his DH.

I remember reading Neftci's treatment of this sort of thing. There is something(everything) which I am not remembering but I am rather distracted and hopefully someone else can be more coherent.",esg
gz0sgj,fvim1g0,icelandman2,"You, as the bank, can issue a ZCB sufficient to return the entire original principal at maturity, which will have some price as a function of issuance currency rates, the bank's credit spreads, and bank appetite for cash at a given tenor. From there, you can get additional cash for option-buying by selling options (e.g. a put spread or a EKIP at maturity). This is what the downside exposure on structured products achieves. 

Now, we just need to account for the upside payout. A snowball autocall is essentially a strip of conditional forward-starting barrier options at some strike (in your case, 110%). The issuer would need to have an overhedge for the barrier unless the underlier is incredibly liquid due to gamma risk. Otherwise, however, this is fairly straightforward to handle. Finally, client is long a vanilla call option at maturity. If the structure calls early, the issuer trades out of the remaining hedge. Some care must be taken in pricing and trading to ensure you're not caught wrong-way on a call date, though not sure to what degree I am allowed to explain what is done to ensure that (and at that point it also becomes somewhat underlier dependant).




Taken together, I'd say client has the following positions (which is what trading will hedge off of):

Long ZCB (returns 100% @call date)

Short ATM-90 put spread at maturity (helps finance upside, and if market down at maturity cuts into the 100% ZCB, but never more than 10%)

Long ATM call at maturity 

Autocalls every other year at 110% call barrier with 6% p/a call premium in years 2,4,6. Autocall not available at maturity (e.g. client long 12% digi struck at 110% in Y2, 24% in Y4, 36% in Y6)

But I've never really had a hard time morally investing in broad index funds. Now that I give it a bit more of my thinking, I'm not entirely sure why I'm so very much ok with it.

Perhaps its because my vote in the entire market is a vote of optimism and faith that the good companies will rise and the less ethical companies will go out of business. I think that this is particularly true in long term investing.

Perhaps it's similar to how anyone that defends our freedoms (Military Service) doesn't just defend the freedoms of the good people, but everyone. A belief in freedom is a general optimistic vote for the future, that more good will come out of it than bad. I generally believe this way in many things that I do. 

But the general pushback to that is well, IF you can do something about helping the good and hurting the bad, aren't you morally obligated to do so?

No socially conscious fund will likely match your morals completely, so if you are that convicted then a portfolio of individual stocks you have researched yourself would be in order.

9hhy2n,e6c9uja,xatlasmjpn,"A [well-reasoned argument](http://www.flannelguyroi.com/case-against-socially-responsible-investing-sri/) against socially responsible investing.

&#x200B;

A problem with socially responsible funds is that someone else is making the decision on your behalf for what counts as “socially responsible” and will be charging you for doing so, to boot. If you want to make a portfolio that matches your own personal ethics, the best way is to do it yourself by picking individual stocks. Of course, this incurs substantial costs in trade commissions and risk/volatility from under-diversification.

Not to mention that (as Flannel Guy ROI states in his case against SRI) buying and selling shares of unsavory companies does very little to hurt/harm their bottom line because it is so far removed from the actual issue of interest. He concludes that it is far better (from a improvement-to-the-world-per-dollar-spent basis) to use your earnings to donate to organizations that directly support your cause of choice.

Finally, once you are FI, you then have the ability spend as much of your time and effort as you wish to support your cause of choice without concern for making a living yourself. If some small fraction of your earnings comes from unsavory businesses, but it enables you to dedicate a portion of your life to making the world better, I believe that it’s a worthy trade-off. After all, the quicker that we can make more socially-responsible people wealthy/powerful, the better off we all will be.",esg

Looking for things I can control using the industries domain knowledge against them is a great solution to this problem.

About ethical investing, I have a little experience being a consumer of these. Here is what I've done and the result: 

Moved Index Funds - I switched some of my invested retirement money from an index fund tracking the S&P 500 (which includes oil and gas companies) to a fund branded as 'socially responsible' that refuses to invest in numerous things which happen to include fossil fuels. Result: Somewhat satisfied. I made slightly less money but my investments did slightly less harm. I generally expect that I will not make MORE money saving the planet. The idea is to leave more resources on the tree for the future generations instead of competing to see who can pick it clean first.

Invested Locally & Directly - this was a lucky find but I saw a link for investors on the website of a company that I know has a history ethical behavior, thats located in the U.S., etc. Since this company is smaller and not publically listed, they valued my money more and gave me a much better return guaranteed than anyone else. I actually just emailed them to ask about buying more but sadly they are not selling anymore and have begun buying people out who want it!!!

The first, the GRI database, is the official database of sustainability reports, with UN backing. It's rigorous, robust, and standardized. It's also complicated and flawed. These reports are generally the best we have and they're not great at actually telling you how sustainable an organization is. 

The second, could be one of many providers of Environmental Social, and Governance (ESG) reports. To be blunt, these reports are fucking greenwashed bullshit. If you find one in the wild, wipe your ass with it because it will have more value.  Unfortunately, ESG is used by investors, consumers, and even researchers to measure sustainability. There is ample research explaining why ESG is bullshit. Different providers (Bloomberg, DJIA, Thompson-Reuters, MCSI and about 100 others) have different standards, qualities, transparencies, and requirements. Companies can pick and choose with ESG service will make themselves look good. Additionally, the rankings each provider seems to produce never converge. If you do go this route, SustainAlytics is one provider probably doing the most right. 

A huge problem in sustainability reports and data, as others have noted, is greenwashing. Additionally, true sustainability is more of a psychology to be studied qualitatively rather than a quantitative pursuit. Judging organizations on whether they are sustainability weak or strong is a task we are struggling to figure out. We kind of know what those ideals mean, but in practice, measurement is fucking complicated.

Blackrock is I believe planning to make ESG funds the default moving forward, UBS, LG Vestra and Brooks McDonald all have significant ESG funds and other companies can tap into pre-made lists and templates to construct their own offerings on the fly.

Shareholders didn’t put pressure on managers to put profits first because they wanted to, it ended up that way because the funds were constructed in such a way that there wasn’t any other choice.  This new fund type changes that.

The key take-away now is that we need to spread the word. Check out your pension plans, do your research and move to an ESG based pension wherever possible.  Then spread the word.

Since 1975, Walden, a  sustainable, responsible, and impact investment and research practice,  has been a leader in helping portfolio managers integrate environmental,  social, and governance considerations into the investment process and  engage in active ownership policies and strategies. Walden provides  research and analysis to support the Adviser.

>The  Walden Funds are subject to screening criteria. Prior to portfolio  construction, the Adviser excludes companies with significant exposure  in specific products or services, considering their revenue dependence,  market share, and severity.

>The  Adviser also evaluates the overall performance of each company,  relative to ESG guidelines, assessing its impact on stakeholders,  performance over time (relative to peers and established goals), and  transparency. Five broad areas encompass the Adviser’s ESG analysis:  products and services; environmental impact; workplace conditions;  community impact; and corporate governance. The Walden Funds may avoid  companies it judges to have substandard performance in one or more of  these areas.

If you just want to avoid Saudi Arabian companies, you could start with an investment in a developed markets fund.  This would include most of the non-Saudi market capitalization, and you could add in individual funds for the other emerging markets if you want to have everything but Saudi Arabia.

If you really do want to avoid only Aramco, then following the everything but Saudi Arabia approach would give about the same result, since the result of the Saudi market is fairly small.

If instead you want to avoid oil companies in general, that might be a bit trickier.  You could invest in sector-specific funds for all the other sectors.  I know there are plenty of such funds for the US though I'm not sure about their availability for the rest of the world.

I believe what you're looking for are SRI (socially responsibly investing) and/or ESG (environmental, social, governance) funds. Within this universe, you can find a lot of actively managed mutual funds and passive index ETFs. Regardless of what option you go with, I would pay attention to the expense ratios and a possible front-end or back-end load (the first time I saw a fund charge a front-end load was when I read the description for a Calvert fund). Besides that, a quick Google search for ""SRI Funds"" should give you a good starting point. 

A common tactic that my company uses is to replace a portion of the Domestic Equity exposure with an SRI-Domestic Equity fund (ex DSI/KSI). That way overall asset allocation is still to par. If your advisor charges based off AUM, then this wouldn't affect their cashflow at all (hence why my company does it). 

One issue that I've found with the SRI/ESG fund universe is that each fund's criteria is different (ie. one fair-labor fund might filter out AAPL due to Foxconn controversy, but another fair-labor fund might include AAPL because of a positive work environment or something). To this, I would strongly recommend you do some research into each fund and read their Prospectus' and/or Morningstar top-10 holdings. 

I'd say that for most of the funds/ETFs, it's unlikely for you to have huge losses. You're more likely to see growth that's less than the index. ",esg

9ioeub,e6llre2,Liljamin,"Good idea to do some further digging when it comes to ESG/impact, making sure you know/can get info on every company within the portfolio and make a judgement for yourself. If I had a dollar for every time I check out a product/fund that markets itself as ethical/ESG or even just future-focused but actually contains fossil fuel/outdated company stocks, I'd have a fair few dollars.

ESG can be a bit wishy washy/box-ticking, so always useful to bkgrnd. check each stock so you know whether it's actually contributing to a more sustainable world/creating impact.

There's a newly launched cleantech-focused managed fund by AtlasTrend called [Clean Disruption](https://www.atlastrend.com/trends/clean-disruption-managed-fund/) (companies disrupting traditional energy i.e. renewables, waste management i.e. recycling, transport i.e. electric vehicles) that fits the 'do good by earth' bill.

there's a lot of worry about fees, which can be misplaced IMHO. middle school math shows that higher fees and higher returns can beat lower fees and low returns. suppose you start with $10,000 invested in each of two funds.

fund A: 8% growth, .05% fee.

fund B: 11% growth, 1.5% fee.

after 1 year, fund A is worth $10,746. fund B is worth $10,933.50. extrapolate these results over 30 years and fund B will result in a larger nest egg than fund A. 

that being said, I'd find a handful of funds with fees under 1% and spread across a few basic categories. keep it simple. large cap, mid cap, small cap, international -- provided their growth rates are in the 10% range. maybe a bond fund if you're risk-averse, but I'm not a big fan of bonds.

If you get the money before tax day in April, you can put $5,500 in a Roth IRA for 2018 with Schwab, Fidelity or Vanguard.  Then put another $6,000 in for 2019.  You can also put aside some money to live on (if you need to) while you max your 401k (if you have one) for 2019 at $19,000 for the year.  Then you could put another $6k in to the IRA in January 2020 for that year, and max the 401k again.

2.  You could put the rest of the money in a taxable brokerage account (I suggest at the same broker you choose for the IRA).  And/or put some in your emergency fund, if that is not large enough already.

3.  I don't love your allocation.  Either invest in a Target Date Index Fund, or mirror a good TDIF with your own portfolio.

efw328,fc2t3be,Laminar_flo,"This is great info but I’ve been doing this a *LONG* time and seen tons of investment fads come and go. Hate to say it, but ESG is just another one. 

People forget this even though it should be obvious, but all hedge funds/mutual funds/PE firms/VC firms have short/medium/long term marketing plans. There are marketing and business development people whose job it is to take the temperature of the world and make sure the firm is positioned properly. 

For example, for the last ~5 years, *everything* is ‘quant’-this and ‘quant’-that. Did funds *really* change their strats? Fuck no. What they did was pay some data aggregator $1M for data access and hire some guy with a MS in statistics to crunch data, *and then went back to doing what they were already doing.* The stat guys job is to provide a ‘quant’ rationale for a decision after the fact. Occasionally, they *might* add some a priori ideas to the ‘investment mix’. 

I’m saying this bc I’ve worked buyside structures credit for over 10 years are we are *very* quant focused (yeah, I was a quant before it was cool) - but my peers and I laugh at what other firms try to get away with under the guise of ‘quant driven’.

Now to ESG - we have a great marketing/BD teams and we are already trying to figure out how to pitch our funds as having an ESG focus without changing our process. For example, I’m already into an energy credit trade - fossil fuels are the opposite of ‘ESG’, right? So I’ll have a junior go find me a way to frame the trade. The credit we bought comes from an oil company that invests a tiny bit in renewables? Perfect! “We chose this credit for both the risk oppy AND due to our commitment to supporting companies the focuses on ESG.” In reality I didn’t change shit. This was the same with ‘quant’, ‘woman focused’, ‘Corp governance’, ‘Corp social responsibility’ etc. 

TLDR: ESG is a marketing phrase and little more. People can be as high minded as they want but it really doesn’t change anything. I’ve been doing this a long time; I’ve seen this movie before and I know how it ends.",esg
efw328,fc2qqdx,Groky1,"There seems to be interest by members of this subreddit to discuss / learn more about impact investing, so here is a thread for us to talk about it and where I can share as much information as possible.

**MY BACKGROUND:** 5+ years of private equity / private debt theme-based impact investing with a focus on climate change, the circular economy and sustainable cities & communities. I work closely with the UN on financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) which recently recognised me as one of 50+ industry leaders worldwide. I am NOT a public markets expert, nor do I know absolutely everything about impact investing. This industry is fast moving, and I learn something new everyday.

**PRIMER:** The image that I linked to this post is the responsible investing spectrum. I’ve found it to be a very good primer when discussing impact investing and how it positions itself versus other types of investments. To summarize the spectrum in plain English:

* **Traditional investing**: Does not take into account Environmental, Social or Governance (ESG) considerations when making an investment decision. These types of investors only focus on financial returns.
* **Responsible investing**: These investors take into account ESG in their risk mitigation strategy. Roughly 25% (roughly $20 Trillion) of all professionally managed assets around the world take into account ESG when making an investment decision (i.e the orange “ESG risk management” bar on the image). Based on existing commitments, it is expected that this percentage will rise to roughly 75% of assets under management (AUM) by 2030 (NEED TO ADD CITATION)

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#430d6f2d1695](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/07/11/the-remarkable-rise-of-esg/#430d6f2d1695)

* **Sustainable / socially responsible investing:** These types of investors don’t just see ESG issues as a risk to mitigate, but they believe that ESG can create opportunities for the companies.
* **Impact Investing:** Impact investing is defined as “Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. Impact investing can be split into two categories depending on the financial returns targeted:

o **Theme based impact investing** (this is what I do)**:** These types of investors seek market rate returns alongside the positive impact generated by their investments.

o **Impact First investing:** These investors are willing to sacrifice some financial return in the hopes of generating more impact; basically have a higher impact per dollar.

* **Philanthropy:** These investors either seek capital preservation (no returns) or offer grants and loss capital (negative returns). I know it looks really weird to put philanthropy on an investment spectrum, and in most cases I would not consider what they do as investing, however when it comes to impact investing these people often play a key role in **blended finance** investments. In these types of investments, the philanthropic capital provide a first loss guarantee / transfer their pro rata returns to other investors; thus derisking the investment opportunity for other investors and catalysing more capital to address the social, economic or environmental issue that they are trying to address.

[http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/blended-finance.htm](http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/blended-finance.htm)

**KEY FACTS & FIGURES:**

A lot of the information here comes from various studies published by the GIIN, you can find them here : [https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/](https://thegiin.org/research-and-opinions/)

\- Size of the market: $502 Billion in 2018. It is expected that the global impact investing market has reached $1 Trillion in 2019

\- About two-thirds of investors seek market-rate returns (66%), and the remaining third are split between those targeting returns closer to market rate (19%) and those targeting returns closer to capital preservation (15%).

As a side note, the vast majority (roughly 90%) of studies show that investments that incorporate ESG analysis outperform non-ESG investments in the long term. This is probably why such a large portion of the financial industry is switching over to ESG strategies.

**COMMON QUESTIONS / COMMENTS:**

**What is the difference between a strong ESG company and an impact company?** For an impact company the impact scales with the size of the business (i.e impact generation IS the business plan), whereas for an ESG company that relationship does not necessarily hold true. For example, Coca cola scores quite well in ESG issues thanks to their sustainable supply chains, good governance etc. but at the end of the day their core business is drinks to people, so selling more doesn\`t automatically mean they are generating more impact. A renewable energy company however generates impact from its core operations.

**Is impact investing in public markets possible?** Historically impact investing has been private investments (debt and equity) since investors have much more control over the company’s impact generation. In my personal opinion, the majority of impact investing in public markets is baloney since investment managers follow a top down investment approach of successive screening. The best (and hardest) way to do impact investing in public markets is bottom up where you go from impact themes, look for companies that operate in those themes, identify the tope performing ones and invest. The best example I have found on the market of this is the Wellington Asset Management Impact strategy.

[https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm\_referrer=https://www.google.ca/](https://www.wellingtonfunds.com/de/en/institutional/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing/impact-investing/?utm_referrer=https://www.google.ca/)

**Does impact investing actually generate the expected returns?** The link below is an oldy but goody (2017 with 2016 data). But long story short, yes the financial returns of impact investments are in line with their non impact peers for both market rate & below market rate investment strategies.

[https://thegiin.org/assets/2017\_GIIN\_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments\_Web.pdf](https://thegiin.org/assets/2017_GIIN_FinancialPerformanceImpactInvestments_Web.pdf)

**Given it's a subset of the market, why do you think you are finding similar risk adjusted returns? Is it primarily due to government subsidy?**  For non-blended investments, I would argue that there are a few things driving returns:

\- More information = better investment decision making : when you're looking at a company / fund from an impact perspective, you're asking a lot more detailed questions about the business and you're getting much more familiar with the market.

\- Different investment opportunities : when you have a bottom up approach where you start from the problem you want to address then look for companies / solutions in that space, you find investment opportunities & strategies that nobody else / very few people have thought of. Given the glut of capital in the markets right now looking for investable opportunities, having fewer people around the table allows to to make better deals.

**This is a whole load of impact-washing / green-washing baloney:**  This is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and the reason why organisations like the GIIN, UN etc. are working so hard to have proper industry standards for impact measurement, management and communication. A lot of progress has been made over the past year however with the launch of IRIS+ by the GIIN and the SDG certification framework by the UN.

eezfa5,fbxg4za,WildFortuna,"The founders of Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga and Klarna as well as the family behind Hennes & Mauritz are raising Europe’s largest early-stage impact investment fund. 

The €100m Swedish fund will invest in companies seeking to solve what it says are the world’s greatest challenges including poverty, food waste and climate change. 

It is seeking to show that impact investing – which has traditionally meant accepting sub-par returns – can deliver results comparable with normal investments. 

“There’s a mantra among investors that you can’t do impact investing and get competitive returns,” Niklas Adalberth, co-founder of Swedish payment unicorn Klarna and a general partner in the fund, told the Financial Times. “We really want to prove this wrong. If we can show that it’s possible to do impact with competitive returns, maybe we can inspire the big capital to follow.” 

Mr Adalberth founded Norrsken Foundation, which houses the fund, three years ago after becoming disillusioned with what he has called “the constant chasing of the next goal or achievement” at Klarna. 

The foundation runs two buildings – one in Stockholm and one in Kigali – offering office space for social entrepreneurs. It also invests directly and through its funds into companies that tackle problems in line with the UN’s sustainable development goals. 

Its first SKr300m ($32m) fund has invested in start-ups such as Karma, which reduces food waste by allowing restaurants and shops to sell surplus produce, and Welcome, an app that helps integrate refugees. 

The new fund is backed by Mr Adalberth; Carl Manneh, co-founder of Minecraft-creator Mojang; Filip Tysander, founder of watch brand Daniel Wellington; Sebastian Knutsson, co- founder of Candy Crush Saga maker King Digital; and Ramsbury, the family office of the Persson family, which founded and controls H&M. 

The fund had its first close of €61m last week and is aiming to raise the full €100m by spring next year. 

Agata Freimane, a former Morgan Stanley banker who is a general partner in the fund, said it was Europe’s — and possibly the world’s — largest early-stage impact investment fund. 

“We feel there’s a strong momentum building around impact. When you look today, many of the top graduates from university are thinking about launching impact start-ups,” she added. 

Mr Adalberth said one of the main goals of the fund was to demonstrate to larger financial institutions it was possible to make impact investments without sacrificing returns. 

“The larger institutions are very conservative,” he added. “It’s hard to get past the switchboard if you talk about impact. A traditional pension fund is required to make a high return and is not able to take the risk. That is why we need to go first and show what is possible.”",esg

My initial thought is that the asset manager would be able to buy more shares in the portfolio companies, which means more votes at the AGM and slightly raise their voices in dialogues with the companies. But in many cases, the ESG asset manager is a minority shareholder with at most 1% of the votes. Thus, I think these asset managers have a small say in the operations of a company. Or am I wrong?

I visited it today and it seems as if they've taken away one of its most useful features, either that or I can't find it with the redesign.  It used to be when looking at a historical snapshot (6 month view, for example) the % change for that time period was shown on the graph.  I can't seem to find that historical % change anywhere now.  Has Google gotten rid of this feature, and if so, what other finance sites might have this data easily accessible?

cakrul,ete5thp,learningcorpfin,"Hi everyone - I'm taking an online basic corporate finance course, and I was hoping someone could help me understand the following two questions included at the end of my textbook chapter. My thoughts are included in bold underneath:

 Suppose that you have a portfolio of two risky stocks with no diversification. What is a possible reason for the lack of diversification?

A) The returns are too small. 

B) The returns move perfectly opposite of one another. 

C) The returns are too large to offset. 

D) The returns move perfectly with one another. 

E) The returns are completely unrelated to one another.

**I think the answer here is ""the returns are completely unrelated to one another"" because we do not know which two stocks we own, what industry, previous performance, etc., which tells me that they are not related to one another and the portfolio holder is taking a ""gamble"" by holding two risky stocks.**

&#x200B;

 The historical average return relationship between securities is (in ascending order): 

A) Lowest return is corporate bonds, government bonds, Treasury bills, small company stocks, highest return all common stocks. 

B) Lowest return is Treasury bills, small company stocks, corporate bonds, government bonds, highest return all common stocks. 

C) Lowest return is Treasury bills, corporate bonds, government bonds, all common stocks, highest return small company stocks. 

D) Lowest return is Treasury bills, government bonds, corporate bonds, all common stocks, highest return small company stocks. 

E) There is no ordering.   
**I believe the answer here is ""D"" because T bills, followed by gov bonds, have the lowest historical return (and answer D is the only one that has this choice in this order).**",esg

""Ordinarily, candidates drop out of the race after poor showings as the season wears on. So what happens when a candidate drops out after having won some delegates? This is actually a little murky. Ostensibly, the delegates go to the national convention uncommitted, like superdelegates. There, they should be allowed to vote however they choose.

These delegates may also be folded into another candidate's delegates. If a candidate drops out of the race, he or she may endorse a rival candidate in the same party. Once this happens, the delegates formerly belonging to the candidate may pledge to the endorsed one.""

EDIT: Thanks to the Redditor who [shared this:](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2020-Delegate-Selection-Rules-12.17.18-FINAL.pdf)

13 states have laws regarding when delegates become uncommitted and allowed to vote their conscience. Iowa and New Hampshire are not part of that group.

Rule 13.I and 13.J of the DNC’s Delegate selection rules are all we have to go by outside of those states. The rules are as follows:

Rule 13.I “No delegate at any level of the delegate selection process shall be mandated by law or Party rule to vote contrary to that person’s presidential choice as expressed at the time the delegate is elected.”

Rule 13.J “Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.”",esg

I grew up gay in a country where lots of people don’t even have a word for it. Enough places on this planet remain homophobic enough that modern US cities are not even on the same spectrum of tolerance. 

President Pete would’ve meant that Salman, Modi, Putin, Xi, Museveni, Imran Khan, Bolsonaro, Duterte, the batshit new leadership in Bolivia and a whole slew of global leaders would’ve had to greet First Husband Chasten in front of the world. Non-English media have to run stories explaining that the most powerful man in the world is married to another man. Kids who don’t even know a name for their confusing state of being would get not just a name but serious validation. Folks who hate would be forced to begrudgingly respect. And folks like my mom, who did not hate but wept thinking that their child had a doomed life, could see that there is potential and possibility for us all. 

In a much more limited manner, he’s already done that and I want to thank and honor him for it.

fc2tzs,fj8k7em,JackAndrewThorne,"So far I've seen 4 polls of Pete voters and they have all shown different second choices, from Bernie winning one, Warren winning one, Biden winning one and then basically a statistical tie between Biden and Bernie. 

I have no clue what impact this is going to have from the polling. My gut is that a lot of less politically interested dem primary voters will go for one of the name rec candidates without Pete, so Bernie or Biden (sorry Liz) and I think the reality is that it will be an even split between those two. Which seems odd but at the same time, while Pete was a moderate, he did have an ability to sound progressive without being progressive. 

The one big thing is Pete is off the stage. Steyer is off the stage. In SC Stayer voters second choices were Biden 40%, Sanders 30%. I imagine that will be split or better for Sanders across the nation (trying to account for SC support vs national). I honestly think the big effect of these two dropouts is more time for each remaining candidate in the debates, and Biden and Bernie breaking further from the pack. 

But then again I am not certain of anything and second choice polls have HUGE MOE's.

>At this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and with the ideals our campaign has been built around is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together. So tonight I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.

>I will no longer seek to be the 2020 Democratic nominee for president. But I’m going to do everything in my power to ensure that we have a Democratic president come January.

>I cannot express how grateful I am for you, soupjaw. How grateful I am for every supporter, every volunteer, and every staffer who believed in what we were building.

>So many of you dug deep to fuel this campaign, joining nearly a million grassroots donors so that this message of hope and belonging could reach every corner of this country.

>Online, in person, with family and friends and complete strangers, you shared your personal stories, and you made the life of this campaign part of your own.

>What you did -- and the way you did it -- let us show, not just tell, the kind of campaign we could be and the kind of country we will build. You made me proud every day.

>In a field in which some two dozen Democratic candidates ran for president -- billionaires, sitting senators, and governors, a former vice president -- we achieved a top-four finish in each of the first four states to hold early contests and made history winning those Iowa caucuses.

>That we made it here at all is proof that Americans are hungry for a new kind of politics, rooted in the values we share.

>In a moment of deep division, we saw a rising American majority of Democrats, joined by Independents, and, yes, some of those future former Republicans, choose a politics defined not by who we push out, but by how many we call in; not by who we exclude, but by how we help people belong.

>With every passing day, I am more and more convinced that the only way we will defeat Trump and Trumpism is with that politics that gathers people together.

>And I urge everyone who supported me or ever even considered it, to be prepared to do everything we can to support the eventual nominee -- and the absolutely critical down-ballot races playing out across the country. There is simply too much at stake to retreat to the sidelines.

>I know many will be disappointed that this campaign will not go on. I know it’s easy to get frustrated with politics, especially at this moment.

>But this is the moment of all moments to insist that we make our politics what it could be. As I’ve said before -- at its best, politics can be magnificent. Because it’s not just about policy, it is soulcraft. And it is moral.

>And we don’t have to win the nomination to be part of that. I don’t have to become the president in order to support that. We don’t have to win Super Tuesday for my campaign to do our part to win the era for our values.

>And we walk on in the knowledge that better leadership is possible. That if we reach for it, if we work for it, if we hold that hope in our hearts and fire in our bellies, then one day we will stand in the future we create, a future where every American is empowered and everyone belongs.

What I really liked about him, apart from the fact that he is clearly well-accomplished and intelligent, that he had a way of explaining progressive policies to people who would automatically oppose it, and explain why it benefits them and the country. It was great. But as soon as he realized that he actually may have a shot of winning, he pivoted because he felt that he couldn't win as a progressive candidate with Bernie and Warren. He got to big for his boots, and cocky about it. Because I truly truly believe that he is more progressive than he campaigned on, if that makes sense. But his ambition is driving him first. 

That being said, to be the first openly gay candidate, who is married, to have come this far is a major accomplishment, and I will never take that away. He has certainly set a precedent and has become a role model in many ways for so many gay, bi-sexual, and queer men in politics.

Warren: 19%

Bloomberg: 17%

Edit: Given the margin of error, it is likely that the effect of Pete's exit from the race will be minimal. Then there is the question of Biden. He pretty much had his dream result last night (his margin was over double his polling average), but whether or not it will be enough is an open question. 72 hours of positive media coverage will definitely help going into the Super Tuesday states, where Biden is significantly out-organized and even more out-spent by both Sanders and Bloomberg.

Maine - Bloomberg very likely to be pushed over 15%.

Massachusetts - Very likely to be no change.

 - Based on current polling Warren is likely to be #2 after Super Tuesday

- Sanders will lose delegates

Maybe Pete wasn't as liberal and progressive as you wanted him to be, but he was just the right amount of liberal as other people wanted. So he ran in an election so that people could make that choice. And when he saw that his momentum bottomed out, he withdrew from the race so that people who liked his flavor of liberalism can now choose a different candidate with better odds of winning.

And maybe, in the interest of both a united front and of not making asses of ourselves, we can accept Pete's withdrawal without immediately assuming that this is a DNC conspiracy against Bernie. This is less of a conspiracy and more *exactly how the fucking primary system works, and exactly why candidates watch the polls prior to Super Tuesday.*

Don't get me wrong, there's definitely reason to suppose party leadership is looking to screw Bernie (and Bernie's my guy), but that doesn't mean we need to sling venom and vitriol to every candidate to the right of Bernie.

His energy, candor, conviction, and ability to bring people together stand against the current of opportunism, moral compromise, and partisanship which runs rampant on the American political scene. He and few others like him have the power to restore principle and leadership in Congress and to win back the faith of a voting public weary and wary of political opportunism.

Ultimately it looks like we are headed to a contested convention. If Sanders has a significant lead I highly doubt they'll take it from him. But if Biden is within 100 delegates, it becomes very easy to start trying to justify giving it to him. Especially if he wins more states overall and Bloomberg has a good chunk of delegates that added to Biden's would push him above Bernie.

Klobuchar staying in is absolutely strategic to take MN delegates. That may be more personal for her to have more power in the convention, but would not be surprised if this was strategic as well.

I don't think it's even ""rigging"". Realistically the centrist candidates should prefer each other to Bernie, and should somewhat work together to get a centrist the nomination.

This election would be easier if all we had to worry about was whether Warren or Sanders offered the best option on Universal Health Care. Or whether Biden or Pete had better stances on immigration. If these were the only things we had to decide on than this election wouldn't be as tense. But the problem isn't just that, it is so much more.

Our world sit on the precipice of being unable to recover from the man made destruction we have wrought upon it. We are now, right this very second, experiencing the effects of Climate change. While it may not seem serious, these are yawn of a terrible giant that will wake up and sow destruction upon this world. It may come off as dramatic but this situation calls for it.

We have to fix this now. We no longer have the luxury of a world where we can kick the can down the road and take care of it when the population is more willing. The time is now to put someone in office who will begin to set this ship of state on the path of reducing carbon emissions and potentially reducing the effects of Climate change. But we cannot do that if the person at the head of this country refuses to acknowledge it.

He dangerous to a degree that is impossible to state properly. He will send this world to a ruin and laugh the entire way knowing he will die before ever feeling the effects of it. Even the smallest shift towards addressing climate change is better than a man who refuses to believe it exists.

Because of this we have an obligation to guarantee that we put someone in office that will at least realize it is the biggest issue facing our species.

These are the facts about Climate change:

\- Climate change is happening and will affect everyone

\- Climate change is inevitable, the severity of it is up to us

\- Climate change does not recognize political alliances

\- Climate change does not recognize race

\- Climate change does not recognize class

It is a steam roller headed towards us at an unending, unimpeded pace as long as we do nothing to try and stop it.

We have to put someone in power who see's this and will act to do something about it. So when the primaries are over, and the candidate is placed on that ballot, remember before and when you go to vote that you aren't voting just for you potential health care system. You aren't just voting for who will deal with immigrants the way you want. You aren't voting for who will or won't institute gun laws.

You are voting for who will work to save our species from the greatest threat it will most likely ever see. We already know Trump's stance on the matter.

> At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. How does a candidate dropping out increase the likelihood of no majority? Shouldn’t it clear the field up and make it easier to achieve a majority?

> The key is in how the Democrats’ delegate math works. The rules require candidates to receive at least 15 percent of the vote, typically, to win delegates statewide or at the district-level.

> Buttigieg was projected to get under 15 percent in the vast majority of states and districts on Super Tuesday. Thus, his votes were essentially wasted. Redistributing his votes to other candidates will help them to meet the 15 percent threshold, however. In particular, Sen.

Our world sit on the precipice of being unable to recover from the man made destruction we have wrought upon it. We are now, right this very second, experiencing the effects of Climate change. While it may not seem serious, these are yawn of a terrible giant that will wake up and sow destruction upon this world. It may come off as dramatic but this situation calls for it.

We have to fix this now. We no longer have the luxury of a world where we can kick the can down the road and take care of it when the population is more willing. The time is now to put someone in office who will begin to set this ship of state on the path of reducing carbon emissions and potentially reducing the effects of Climate change. But we cannot do that if the person at the head of this country refuses to acknowledge it.

He dangerous to a degree that is impossible to state properly. He will send this world to a ruin and laugh the entire way knowing he will die before ever feeling the effects of it. Even the smallest shift towards addressing climate change is better than a man who refuses to believe it exists.

Because of this we have an obligation to guarantee that we put someone in office that will at least realize it is the biggest issue facing our species.

These are the facts about Climate change:

\- Climate change is happening and will affect everyone

\- Climate change is inevitable, the severity of it is up to us

\- Climate change does not recognize political alliances

\- Climate change does not recognize race

\- Climate change does not recognize class

It is a steam roller headed towards us at an unending, unimpeded pace as long as we do nothing to try and stop it.

We have to put someone in power who see's this and will act to do something about it. So when the primaries are over, and the candidate is placed on that ballot, remember before and when you go to vote that you aren't voting just for you potential health care system. You aren't just voting for who will deal with immigrants the way you want. You aren't voting for who will or won't institute gun laws.

Raw passion that’s been waiting for a candidate like Bernie for years, even decades for some. He’s given a lot of us a hope about what this country could be.

I’m an Indian American that became a naturalized US citizen when I was in my teens. I grew up in rural Georgia where it was tough to be Hindu in a massive Christian community, but what I learned from my friends that I made is that one of the most important thing about your scriptures is to love. Love thy neighbor in particular here.

What I also see in this man and his campaign is to look around you. Look at the world we live in and see the people who have not been as fortunate as us to live difficult lives to survive and provide for their family. My father worked very hard once we got here from Bombay to make it and with sheer will we did, but we cannot forget the ones who did the same and didn’t have the same luck.

I think Bernie could actually do really well in the midwest, better than Biden. Which is really valuable in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio.

Florida is full of Cubans and Old people which could make it unwinnable for Bernie.

Pennsylvania currently has 350,000 people who work in the natural gas industry. If I work for the Trump campaign I'm running ads there every single day reminding people that he wants to ban fracking

Even if Bernie does get elected (and I voted for Bernie in 2016, undecided as to the primary), or it was Warren, Yang, etc. unless they executive orders almost all of their policies, they won't have enough support to go through Congress. And you can't enact a lot of these by executive order alone.

But I didn't vote for him and wouldn't because I think he has not been accountable for his time in South Bend in regards to the black population there, nor does he really seem to be able to even say that mistakes were made. This is a disqualifier, even before getting to how little he tracks with minority voters and how a Presidential Campaign with him wouldn't be viable. I think his takeup of funding to stay in as long as he did with very wealthy donors was also disapponting. 

That being said, I think in the dogma of some Dems, or people left of center if you prefer without party labels, there really is way too much antagonism towards him based on policy. To say he's CIA, a rat, a centrist, a Republican, etc. is all a bit ridiculous. Compare him to Obama or Hillary and he's way more progressive, and in some ways more reform-oriented than even Sanders or Warren (filibuster, Supreme Court, etc.). If he had been elected, his platform compared to all other elected presidents would probably be the most progressive since FDR. I also think people saying he isn't genuine, that he's fake or phony can be overly vitriolic. Maybe because I kind of also have a monotone type voice and ""vanilla"" way of presenting myself, but don't equate the way in which one speaks as indicative of who they are. Trump bellows and rants and he's the fakest, phoniest, arguable most successful con artist in history.

So I am sad to see him go in a weird way, not because I was going to vote for him, but I feel like if he had done things differently, especially be accountable, he could have done much better. It's a pretty fantastic run as a mayor from a small-size city though. I don't think he's ever going to be president: the progressive wing disproportionately hates him and he has little to no pull with minorities, but I'm sure he will have a bright future somewhere in politics. If he does want to run again in the future, he needs to do something about his record with minorities, but of what, I'm not sure.",esg

fc2tzs,fj881sk,cybermort,Hope their plan to make Biden viable in California with this move is thwarted thanks to early voting.,esg
fc2tzs,fj88b7c,TheCavis,"Wow. This is genuinely surprising. I'm genuinely wondering if another shoe will drop (endorsing Biden in anticipation of a cabinet spot or even maybe a Biden/Buttigieg ticket?). The Super Tuesday map was bad for him (as in, ""he was probably getting fewer delegates than Klobuchar"" bad), but he's still in third place at the moment. There's no real downside to staying in three more days and then quietly bowing out. Early voting's already happened! You told your voters that their support mattered and then dropped out after they locked in their support for you but before their vote actually mattered!

In terms of effect, his vote in the latest Morning Consult split four ways (21% Bernie, 19% Biden, 19% Warren, 17% Bloomberg). Quinnipiac had a different four way split (26% Klob, 26% Warren, 19% Biden, 11% Sanders) a few weeks ago. Either way, it'll be spread so thin and early voting has been strong enough thus far that I don't think it'll affect the margins on Super Tuesday much, but could have significant impacts on viability. I would wager: 

- Good for Biden long-term. If the Klob-to-Pete pipeline we saw in Iowa gets cut off, her voters will naturally go to him if/when she drops out after Super Tuesday. He also needed the field to winnow to him and this is that first step.

- Good for Warren short-term. If she takes a quarter of Pete's voters, that gives her a couple of points in California, which is a necessary bit of breathing room with regards to viability. Same with Colorado and maybe Utah. But mostly California. If she can pull in a larger chunk in MA (depending on how much was lost to early voting), she could defend home turf as well.

- Moral victory for Klob. She may not have more delegates, but she outlasted him. I don't think it affects her chances of winning significantly, which I still have as 0% (plus or minus 0%). 

- Bad for Bernie, but not overly so. He'll still get the wins and headlines, but more eligible people means more delegate splitting and smaller delegate margins. Avoiding a contested convention just got harder. 

- Uncertain for Bloomberg. Maybe he gets viable in places but also maybe Biden picks up the larger chunk of Pete voters and generates a significant moderate lead, letting Klob drop out and forcing Bloomberg into the ""you're just splitting Biden's vote and getting Bernie elected"" position, which is the *opposite* of what he wants. Honestly, though, I don't understand his campaign or supporters at all, so I have no idea how it'll work out.

I'm honestly shocked right now. This is absolute pure electoral chaos injected into the race during what's usually the calm before the Super Tuesday storm.",esg

fc2tzs,fj8woge,mrbrinks,"The Buttigieg, Warren, and Biden campaigns are all working together, likely alongside party insiders, to do everything possible to force a contested convention, and thus stop Sanders from winning the nomination.

By dropping out, Pete helps boost Biden's numbers directly, while also helping Bloomberg and Warren push up above viability. Them going from 12-14% to 15-16% is *huge* for delegate math. There's no way Warren can *win*, but she certainly can accrue delegates to help block Sanders. In fact, her campaign **outright admitted it was staying in to force a contested convention:** [https://twitter.com/aishaismad/status/1233899739906813952](https://twitter.com/aishaismad/status/1233899739906813952)

3. This should throw the Sanders camp off.  Even though Warren hasn't done really well, she's still siphoning off votes in a race she simply cannot win.  It seems like it's time for Warren to bow out and endorse Bernie.  If she doesn't, it looks like Biden could really push Bernie for the nomination.  If that happens, we know how it will play out.

He was whatever you wanted him to be, which is why the corporate-billionaire class liked him and funded him. 

In the end, what most people knew was that he was nakedly ambitious and reeked of someone desperate for power, without communicating what he would do with it.  He wasn't fighting for change, or status quo, or anything, he just wanted status and influence from the position.

Biden is on some crazy pills that makes him oblivious to decent shit, and Bloomberg is, well a piece of shit who is literally trying to buy the election. Also the younger generation has to get out and vote. This is an absolute necessity. 
1 Trump cant go for another 4 years. We are going to be in ww3 and we're all gonna be so fucked that there will be no coming back. We can still repair the damage set by Trump and his absolutely incompetent administration. Even if people don't like Bernies policies, they need to vote for him. Bernie is the type of President we need in after all this shit because he listens to other opinions. He's been doing this shit since the civil rights movement. He will be able to work with both sides to fix what is wrong. Not to mention our Allies love Bernie. So he can patch up the obliteration of our pacts with our Allies. Nobody else can beat Trump. If Bernie gets knocked out then majority of his supporters will stay away from voting. Because they absolutely can not stand any other candidate. They want the new policies put into place that can help give hope for a future. Bernie gets knocked out supporters will lose all hope of having a sustainable future and they wil not give a fuck about as with the people who don't like Bernie and want someone else to be the Dem Nom, they aren't as desperate for the changes Bernie wants to make and they can see a better future. So they can find a nomination next election or 2028 to try for those policies. We supporting Bernie are fucking desperate for his policies because hes the only Candidate who wants to change the whole system so we can have shit we can afford but absolutely need. Basically we need Bernie to get the Nomination and we need him to win. Because Trump CAN NOT be in for another 4 years. He got off from impeachment on some crooked ass shit and he has shown time and time again that he doesn't give a flying fuck about the Constitution and has done absolutely horrible things a president should never do. Another 4 years and he's gonna go all out. 

Younger Generations who just turned 18 and those who can vote for the 1st time. Those who between the ages of 18-35 even higher, get out to the polls. Get out there and vote for Bernie. Bring back some damn stabilization to our government and let's shut these racist Trump supporters who have done nothing but plague our country with hate speeches and have let to an influx in believing opinion over facts and let's finally put an end to their damn charade.

I work at a company that employs over 100,000 people around the world. And while I think most would agree with your view of the 07-08 crisis, it’s also scary to consider voting for someone that wants to dismantle your employer with no mention of what that means for you. Especially when said employer has already implemented many ideas from the 2016 election making it a great place to work that provides a living wage, free health coverage, and other benefits.

Obviously I think everyone deserves those things but I don’t know that the majority of the country can get on board with policies they don’t understand or think we can pay for. If they can’t, we get 4 more years of Trump which is far worse than slow changes.

Despite all of these thoughts I still really dislike Biden and don’t think he wants to change enough.",esg

If candidate A has 40%, candidate B 22% but all the eliminated candidates of 1st round (C,D,E etc) prefer that B becomes president and support him in the 2nd round, B will win the 2nd round. Because he is not the most popular, but because A is the one that is not accepted by anyone else except his voters. Sanders is A in the Democratic party.",esg

fc2tzs,fj8eura,angelol90,"So, Steyer and Buttigieg dropping out, ultimately reveals that from the start, the DNC's strategy was all about the ""subtract the available candidates - quantity, to increase our chosen candidate's quality"" mentality.



Buttigieg came really close in Iowa and continued the trend in New Hampshire, depriving enough momentum generating delegates from Bernie· practically cutting them in half, while Steyer coming 3rd in South Carolina, successfully stripped away many Bernie potential votes, and thus, amplified Biden's win in the end. After all, if Bernie got 31% instead of 20% (his 20% and Steyer's 11%) in SC - resulting in a 18% difference from Biden, the results would just be an inverse Nevada situation for Biden against Bernie, and a less beneficial one for Biden, not this media portrayed orgasmic-triumph, and its yet to be seen effect in the coming Super Tuesday elections, no matter how small hopefully that effect will be. 



Nevertheless, even though at first glance, the obvious takeaway is that they both performed somewhat successful in their roles to serve as a handbrake for Bernie, in more depth, the DNC was testing the waters all along, by pouring in a plethora of candidates, and taking its time to find its most suitable anti-Bernie candidate, since it simultaneously built him from the ground up, as well as providing more focal points for Bernie, making his efforts have a lesser effect. Concisely, they poured in all these different types of candidates, so they could conduct continuous measurements on the electoral body, by testing all the possible complex fluid dynamics, so that in the end, they'd end up with a candidate that fulfills 3 traits: One that -

* Is perceived by the average Joe to be able to beat Trump

* Is a better democrat than Sanders, because, of course socialism=communism

* If he fails to meet the 2 aforementioned criteria, he'd still provide another front for Bernie to focus, making it harder for him to make a point for his campaign and his candidacy.",esg

Realizing this forced me to begrudgingly admit that my ideal candidate, the man that represents me fully, would not be right for the country. Not now at least.

So I said that whomever appeared to me to be closest to a politcal moderate would have my vote. Even if I disagreed with many or even all of his or her policies. Mayor Pete rapidly became that man. He seemed the only one with the calm integrity to sit down and make compromises with the other party. His Medicare for all that want it plan seemed the only sensible option to make everyone happy. Time and time again durring the debates he shined with his middle of the road, let's work together to get this country back on its feet attitude. 

It's been a very very long time since I have felt so inspired by a candidate running for president. Since Ron Paul. Now that hes gone I feel like my choices are socialist left and authoritarian right. The middle has dried up. I'm filled with dread and worry for this countries future and truly feel that no matter the outcome the country will only be divided more.

Edit: I should have known better then to share my honest opinion and feelings on reddit. I apologize. Sanders 2020! Happy?",esg

Can you imagine having the moderately progressive candidate who genuinely inspires you being constantly called a ""Republican rat"" anywhere you go? Can you imagine seeing homophobic slur after homophobic slur being thrown his way, knowing full well they would say the same to you? And now these people are arguing we should burry the hatchet?

Many 401k plans have a brokerage/PCRA option, which will allow you to purchase ETFs even if they're not default options in the plan.
